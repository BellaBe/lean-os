# Stage 1: Input

**Thread:** Evaluate AI Code Assistant Adoption
**Type:** operations
**Goal:** g-developer-productivity (SG2: Improve development tooling)
**Created:** 2025-01-15

## Observation

Team velocity has decreased 15% over the past quarter. Developer surveys indicate significant time spent on:
- Boilerplate code writing (estimated 20% of coding time)
- Documentation lookup (estimated 15% of coding time)
- Code review preparation (estimated 10% of coding time)

**Source:** Q4 sprint retrospectives, time tracking data, developer survey (n=8)

## Context

- Team size: 8 developers
- Current tools: VS Code, GitHub Copilot trial expired
- Budget: $500/month available for tooling
- Constraint: Must integrate with existing VS Code workflow

## Question

Should we adopt an AI code assistant to improve developer productivity?
