### Velocity Metrics

| Metric | Baseline | Trial Period | Change |
|--------|----------|--------------|--------|
| Sprint velocity | 40 pts | 52 pts | **+30%** |
| Boilerplate time | 20% | 8% | -60% |
| Doc lookup time | 15% | 10% | -33% |
| Code review prep | 10% | 7% | -30% |

### Quality Metrics

| Metric | Baseline | Trial Period | Change |
|--------|----------|--------------|--------|
| Bug rate | 2.1/sprint | 1.8/sprint | -14% |
| PR rejection rate | 12% | 10% | -17% |
| Test coverage | 78% | 82% | +5% |

### Cost Analysis

- **Investment:** $100/month (team plan)
- **Velocity gain:** +30% = ~$75K/quarter value
- **Actual ROI:** 75:1

## Hypothesis Validation

**Status:** ✅ VALIDATED

**Prior confidence:** 60%
**Posterior confidence:** 95%

**Evidence:** Velocity increased 30% (exceeds 15% threshold), quality metrics improved.

## Canvas Updates

**Updated:** `strategy/canvas/10.assumptions.md`

```
A7: AI code assistants can reduce development time by 20%+
Status: validated → VALIDATED
Confidence: 60% → 95%
Evidence: 30-day trial showed 30% velocity increase with quality improvement
```

## Goal State Update

**Goal:** g-developer-productivity
**Subgoal:** SG2 - Improve development tooling

- **Status:** pending → completed
- **Outcome:** Claude Code adopted as standard tool
- **Metric contribution:** +30% velocity toward goal target

## Key Learnings

1. **AI assistants excel at boilerplate** - 60% reduction exceeded expectations
2. **Quality improved, not degraded** - AI suggestions caught errors
3. **Adoption was smooth** - 2-week pilot sufficient for team confidence
4. **Best for senior devs** - Juniors needed more guidance on when to accept suggestions

## Follow-up Actions

- [ ] Create onboarding guide for new developers
- [ ] Establish prompt library for common tasks
- [ ] Schedule 90-day review to confirm sustained gains
