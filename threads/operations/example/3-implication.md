# Stage 3: Implication

**Thread:** Evaluate AI Code Assistant Adoption

---

## Impact Analysis

### If Hypothesis Validated (Adopt Tool)

| Metric | Current | Projected | Impact |
|--------|---------|-----------|--------|
| Sprint velocity | 40 pts | 48 pts | +20% |
| Time to feature | 2 weeks | 1.6 weeks | -20% |
| Developer satisfaction | 6.5/10 | 8/10 | +23% |

**Revenue impact:** Faster feature delivery → estimated $50K additional revenue/quarter from faster time-to-market

**Cost:** $50-100/developer/month × 8 = $400-800/month

**ROI:** ($50K/quarter) / ($2.4K/quarter) = 20:1

### If Hypothesis Invalidated (Don't Adopt)

- Continue with current workflow
- Explore alternative productivity improvements
- Re-evaluate in 6 months with new tools

## Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|------------|------------|
| Learning curve disruption | Medium | Phase rollout, start with 2 developers |
| Code quality decline | Low | Maintain code review standards |
| Security concerns | Low | Choose SOC2 compliant vendor |
| Vendor lock-in | Medium | Ensure export capability |

## Priority Score

**Calculation (BOOTSTRAP mode):**
- Revenue Impact: 0.8
- Time to Cash: 0.9 (immediate productivity gains)
- Margin: 0.95 (high ROI)

**Score:** (0.8 × 0.9 × 0.95) / 3 = **0.76**

*Below 0.8 threshold - AI can proceed autonomously*
