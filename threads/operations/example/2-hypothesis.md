# Stage 2: Hypothesis

**Thread:** Evaluate AI Code Assistant Adoption

---

## Assumption Being Tested

**A7:** AI code assistants can reduce development time by 20%+ without significant quality degradation.

**Link:** `strategy/canvas/10.assumptions.md`

## Hypothesis

If we adopt an AI code assistant (Claude Code or GitHub Copilot), then:
- Boilerplate coding time will decrease by 50%+
- Documentation lookup time will decrease by 30%+
- Overall developer velocity will increase by 15-25%

## Confidence Level

**Prior confidence:** 60%
**Based on:** Industry reports, team member previous experience with Copilot trial

## Test Criteria

- **Validated if:** Measured velocity increase ≥15% after 30-day trial
- **Invalidated if:** Velocity increase <10% OR quality metrics decline >5%
