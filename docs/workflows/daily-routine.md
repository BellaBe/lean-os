# Daily Routine

Human touchpoint: <30 min/day on operations.

## Goal-Oriented Workflow

LeanOS operates through goals, not daily dashboards. Your interaction is goal-focused.

```
Morning: Check goal progress (on-demand snapshot)
As needed: Approve high-impact actions
Weekly: Review goal trajectory, adjust priorities
```

---

## Morning Review (5 minutes)

### Check Active Goals

```
Ask: "What's the status of my goals?"
Skill: goal-tracker (on-demand snapshot)
```

**Snapshot shows:**
- Goal progress (metrics vs targets)
- Gaps identified
- Recommended actions
- Threads needing attention

**Example:**
```markdown
# Goal Snapshot - 2025-12-10

## g-mrr-50k: Reach $50K MRR by Q2
**Progress:** 48% ($24K / $50K)
**Trajectory:** On track
**Risk:** Low

### Gaps
- Pipeline needs 8 more qualified leads

### Recommended Actions
1. Create outbound campaign thread (auto-approved)
2. Review stalled deal: Acme Corp (needs attention)

## g-linkedin-authority: Build LinkedIn Presence
**Progress:** 62% (6.2K / 10K followers)
**Trajectory:** Ahead of schedule
**Risk:** Low

### Active Threads
- content-q4-campaign (Stage 5: executing)
```

---

## Human Actions (3-5 minutes)

1. **Review recommendations** (1 min) - Approve/defer suggested actions
2. **Check flagged items** (1-2 min) - High-impact decisions (≥0.8 score)
3. **Unblock threads** (1 min) - Resolve any blocked items

## AI Handles Autonomously

Based on goal autonomy settings:

**Auto mode (no approval needed):**
- Thread creation for gap-closing
- Content generation
- Prospect research
- Pipeline updates
- Low-impact decisions (<0.8)

**Ask mode (approval required):**
- High-impact decisions (≥0.8)
- Canvas-altering changes
- Budget commitments
- Strategic pivots

**Hybrid mode (default):**
- Auto for impact <0.5
- Ask for impact ≥0.5

## Weekly Review (30 min)

### Goal Trajectory Review

```
Ask: "Review all goal trajectories"
Skill: goal-tracker
```

**Review:**
- On-track vs off-track goals
- Completed subgoals this week
- Upcoming milestones
- Gaps requiring new threads

### Adjust Priorities

- Reprioritize goals if needed
- Adjust autonomy levels
- Close or abandon stalled goals
- Create new goals for emerging needs

---

## Interaction Patterns

### Check specific goal
```
"How is g-mrr-50k progressing?"
```

### Create new goal
```
"I want to launch the mobile app by March"
Skill: goal-setter → creates goal with plan
```

### Review all gaps
```
"What gaps need attention?"
Skill: goal-tracker → shows all gaps with recommendations
```

### Approve action
```
"Approve the outbound campaign thread"
→ Thread created, linked to goal
```

## Key Principle

**Goals are your interface. Not dashboards, not daily files.**

- Goals track their own state
- Threads execute goal subgoals
- Snapshots are computed on-demand
- Canvas updates flow from goal completion
