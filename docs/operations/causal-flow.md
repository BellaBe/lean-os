# 6-Stage Causal Flow

Universal decision framework for business, sales, and marketing threads.

## Overview

Every decision flows through 6 stages:
**Input → Hypothesis → Implication → Decision → Actions → Learning**

## Stage 1: INPUT

**Purpose:** Capture factual observation (not opinion)

**Process:**
- Record what happened
- Include numbers, dates, names
- Link to source

**Example:**
```
ElsaAI deal closed: $1.1M ARR, 38% return reduction
Source: Signed contract + pilot results
Date: 2024-11-15
```

**Skill:** `causal-flow/stages/causal-flow-input/`

---

## Stage 2: HYPOTHESIS

**Purpose:** Challenge/validate Canvas assumptions

**Process:**
- Identify which assumption this tests
- Link to `strategy/canvas/10-assumptions.md`
- State confidence level

**Example:**
```
Tests: A4 - Luxury brands prefer white-label
Result: Validated (5/5 chose white-label)
Confidence: 60% → 95%
```

**Skill:** `causal-flow/stages/causal-flow-hypothesis/`

## Stage 3: IMPLICATION

**Purpose:** Analyze business impact with numbers

**Process:**
- Quantify impact (revenue, cost, time)
- Calculate ROI or priority
- Identify risks

**Example:**
```
Impact: 500 sessions/month → 25 demos
Revenue: $5M pipeline influenced
Investment: 40 hours
Priority: 0.85
```

**Skill:** `causal-flow/stages/causal-flow-implication/`

## Stage 4: DECISION

**Purpose:** Official commitment

**Process:**
- State decision (CREATE, DEFER, REJECT)
- Document alternatives
- Explain reasoning

**Example:**
```
Decision: CREATE - High-priority content
Alternatives: Wait (rejected), Guide (rejected)
Rationale: 95% confidence, validates hypothesis
```

**Skill:** `causal-flow/stages/causal-flow-decision/`

## Stage 5: ACTIONS

**Purpose:** Execute tasks

**Typed actions:**
- Sales: lead-intake, qualify, demo, pilot, close
- Marketing: create, publish, promote, measure

**Templates:** `causal-flow/actions/templates/`

**Skill:** `causal-flow/stages/causal-flow-actions/`

---

## Stage 6: LEARNING

**Purpose:** Validate hypothesis, update Canvas

**Process:**
- Compile metrics
- Validate/invalidate hypothesis
- Auto-update Canvas
- Detect new opportunities

**Key feature:** Automatically updates Canvas assumptions

**Skill:** `causal-flow/stages/causal-flow-learning/`

---

## Thread Types

**Business threads:** `threads/business/{name}/`
- Strategic decisions
- Canvas updates
- Process improvements

**Sales threads:** `threads/sales/{name}/`
- Deal progression
- Campaign execution
- Pipeline management

**Marketing threads:** `threads/marketing/campaigns/{slug}/`
- Content execution
- Campaign tracking
- Performance analysis
