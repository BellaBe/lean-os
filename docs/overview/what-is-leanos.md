# What is LeanOS?

## The Problem

Traditional startups face critical operational bottlenecks:

- **Founder bottleneck:** Every decision requires human input, limiting growth
- **Information fragmentation:** Data scattered across Notion, Slack, email, docs
- **Context switching:** 20+ switches per day destroying productivity
- **No clear priorities:** "What needs my attention NOW?" is unclear
- **Linear human scaling:** Company growth requires proportional human scaling

## The Solution

LeanOS is an AI-native operating system designed to run a company with minimal human intervention. Initially built for GlamYouUp (AI fashion recommendations SaaS), it automates 95%+ of operational decisions while maintaining strategic human oversight.

**Core capabilities:**

- **Builds + runs systems:** Category-theoretic system design for building production-ready backends, then autonomous sales, marketing, and business operations
- **AI-first execution:** Claude agents process engineering, sales, marketing, and business decisions autonomously
- **Single source of truth:** Lean Canvas (15 living documents) drives all operations
- **Thread-based decisions:** Complete decision narratives with causal flow (6 stages)
- **Human touchpoint:** ops/today.md - Single daily entry point (auto-generated)
- **Learning-driven content:** Marketing creates content when business generates insights
- **Closed-loop attribution:** Sales learning triggers marketing, marketing drives sales

**Result:** Company scales without linear human scaling. Founder focuses on high-leverage activities: <30 min/day on operations.

## Core Principles

### 1. AI-First Execution
Claude skills handle operations, not just documentation. Skills make decisions, generate materials, publish content, and track performance autonomously.

### 2. Context-Shaping Over Generalization
Each skill targets specific decision types with domain-specific reasoning. No generic "AI assistant" - specialized agents for ICP generation, sales narratives, content strategy, etc.

### 3. Zero Redundancy
Information exists in ONE location only. Canvas is source of truth. Threads store decisions. Artifacts contain deliverables. No duplication across systems.

### 4. Evidence-Based Decisions
All choices trace to Canvas assumptions or thread results. No opinions without data. Every decision links to hypothesis being tested.

### 5. Human Touchpoint (ops/today.md)
Single daily entry point (auto-generated). Founder reviews priorities, approves high-leverage decisions, ignores 95% of autonomous operations.

### 6. Learning-Driven Content
Marketing creates content when business generates insights worth sharing. No arbitrary calendars. Sales learning triggers content opportunities.

### 7. Closed-Loop Attribution
Sales threads capture learning → Marketing creates content → Content drives demos → Demo threads track attribution → Learning validates assumptions.

### 8. Mode-Aware Operations
Adapts to VENTURE (scale-focused) or BOOTSTRAP (profit-focused) business models. Decision criteria, metrics, and research approaches adjust based on mode. Same system, different priorities.

### 9. Compositional System Design (Engineering Layer)
Category theory principles for building mathematically correct, composable systems. Transform natural language requirements into production-ready microservices with type safety, standardization, and automatic validation. Engineering layer optional - activate only when building technical products.

## How It's Different

| Traditional Startup | LeanOS |
|---------------------|--------|
| Manual system architecture | Category-theoretic design (mathematically correct) |
| Human decides everything | AI decides 95%, human approves high-leverage items |
| Information scattered | Single source of truth (Canvas) |
| Ad-hoc decision-making | 6-stage causal flow (evidence-based) |
| One-size-fits-all metrics | Mode-aware (VENTURE vs BOOTSTRAP execution) |
| Calendar-driven marketing | Learning-driven content |
| Manual attribution tracking | Automated closed-loop attribution |
| Founder works 60+ hours/week | Founder works <30 min/day on operations |

## Design Philosophy

**Production-ready, not theoretical:** Every skill produces executable outputs. No conceptual frameworks without implementation.

**Question assumptions:** Canvas tracks hypotheses with confidence scores. Learning validates or invalidates assumptions continuously.

**Designed for universality:** Built for GlamYouUp, designed for any B2B SaaS. Same skills, different Canvas.

**Continuous improvement:** Performance tracking feeds insights back to strategy. Meta-learning detects patterns across threads.

**Authority through depth:** Educational content with technical depth. No engagement tricks or sales CTAs.

**AI-operated, human-supervised:** Human provides strategic direction and quality control. AI handles execution and optimization.

## Success Metrics

**Operational efficiency:**
- <30 min/day human time on operations
- >95% AI autonomy rate

**Information quality:**
- Zero duplication (1 source of truth)
- 100% decision traceability
- >95% Canvas auto-update accuracy

**Business impact:**
- Sales pipeline velocity tracked per stage
- Marketing content attribution to pipeline
- Validated assumptions drive strategy

## Who Should Use LeanOS?

**Ideal fit:**
- Solo founders or small teams (1-3 people)
- B2B SaaS or marketplace businesses (especially technical products)
- Pre-product to early traction stage
- Technical founder comfortable with AI tools and category theory concepts
- Building microservices/backend systems (engineering layer)
- Values evidence-based decision-making
- **Both venture-backed (scale focus) and bootstrapped (profit focus) founders**

**Not ideal for:**
- Large teams with established processes
- Consumer apps requiring high-touch support
- Businesses without clear ICP/segments
- Founders preferring human-driven operations

## What You Need

**Technical:**
- Claude AI access (Sonnet 4.5)
- Git for version control
- Terminal/command line comfort
- Markdown editing capability

**Business:**
- Clear business idea or existing product
- Willingness to populate Lean Canvas
- Commitment to evidence-based decisions
- Time for customer validation (real-world bottleneck)

**Mindset:**
- Trust AI for execution, human for strategy
- Embrace learning-driven content (no arbitrary calendars)
- Accept 95% of operations happen without your input
- Focus on high-leverage activities only
