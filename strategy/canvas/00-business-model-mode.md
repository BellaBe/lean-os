# Business Model Mode

**Current Mode:** [SELECT: VENTURE | BOOTSTRAP | HYBRID]

---

## Mode Declaration

**Active Mode:** BOOTSTRAP

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-18

**Rationale:**
- Self-funded, no outside capital raised
- Need profitability within 3 months
- Revenue-first approach to validate market
- Exit optional, cash flow primary goal

---

## Mode Definitions

### VENTURE Mode

**Capital Strategy:**
- Funded by investors (angels, VCs)
- Burn rate acceptable for growth
- Runway: 12-24+ months
- Exit: Acquisition or IPO (7-10 years)

**Decision Sequence:**
```
Idea → Product → Market Fit → Scale → Monetization
```

**Success Metrics:**
- Monthly Active Users (MAU)
- User Growth Rate (%)
- Market Share (%)
- Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)
- Total Addressable Market (TAM)
- Burn Rate & Runway

**Research Focus:**
- TAM calculations (billion-dollar markets)
- Growth rates and trends
- Competitive landscape
- Defensibility and moats
- Scalability potential
- 10x opportunities

**Product Approach:**
- Build comprehensive platform
- Long-term strategic features
- Network effects and moats
- Scale before monetization
- Revolutionary capabilities

**Go-to-Market:**
- Brand building
- Content marketing
- Community development
- Thought leadership
- Viral growth loops
- Enterprise sales (if B2B)

**Impact Scoring:**
```
Impact = (Strategic Value × Market Size × Defensibility) / 3

Where:
- Strategic Value: Advances core hypothesis? (0-1)
- Market Size: Unlocks larger TAM? (0-1)
- Defensibility: Creates moat? (0-1)

Threshold: ≥0.8 requires human approval
```

### BOOTSTRAP Mode

**Capital Strategy:**
- Self-funded or profitable from month 1-3
- Zero/low burn rate
- Runway: Infinite (via profitability)
- Exit: Optional, business can run indefinitely

**Decision Sequence:**
```
Market Gap → Monetization Model → Minimal Product → Scale if Profitable
```

**Success Metrics:**
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
- Monthly Profit (MP)
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
- Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)
- Profit Margin (%)
- Cash Flow

**Research Focus:**
- Current spend mapping (who pays what today)
- Budget holder identification
- Arbitrage opportunities
- Existing procurement processes
- Margin analysis
- Immediate revenue potential

**Product Approach:**
- Minimal viable solution
- One clear pain point
- Immediately monetizable
- Build in weeks, not months
- Proven solution, not innovation

**Go-to-Market:**
- Direct outreach
- Partnership channels
- Arbitrage in advertising
- Immediate conversion focus
- Personal sales
- Low/no-cost acquisition

**Impact Scoring:**
```
Impact = (Revenue Impact × Time to Cash × Margin) / 3

Where:
- Revenue Impact: Monthly recurring revenue potential? (0-1)
- Time to Cash: How fast to first payment? (0-1, higher=faster)
- Margin: Profit margin percentage? (0-1)

Threshold: ≥0.8 requires human approval
```

### HYBRID Mode

**Capital Strategy:**
- Bootstrap to profitability first
- Raise funding after product-market fit proven
- Use funding to scale what's already working
- Exit: Optional, but optimized for acquisition

**Decision Sequence:**
```
Market Gap → Monetization → Prove PMF → Raise → Scale → Exit
```

**Success Metrics:**
- Early stage: Bootstrap metrics (MRR, profit, CAC)
- Growth stage: Venture metrics (ARR, growth rate, market share)

**Research Focus:**
- Phase 1: Bootstrap approach (immediate revenue)
- Phase 2: Venture approach (scale what works)

**Product Approach:**
- Start minimal (bootstrap)
- Scale proven features (venture)

**Go-to-Market:**
- Phase 1: Direct, low-cost channels
- Phase 2: Funded marketing and sales

**Impact Scoring:**
- Use Bootstrap formula until profitable
- Switch to Venture formula after funding

## Mode Implications for LeanOS Operations

### Research Priorities

**Venture Mode:**
- ✅ TAM calculations and market sizing
- ✅ Competitive landscape analysis
- ✅ Long-term trend identification
- ✅ Scalability assessment
- ❌ Immediate monetization paths
- ❌ Current spend mapping

**Bootstrap Mode:**
- ✅ Who pays for this today (budget holders)
- ✅ Existing spend and procurement processes
- ✅ Arbitrage and margin opportunities
- ✅ Immediate revenue potential (this quarter)
- ❌ TAM projections
- ❌ Long-term market trends

### Product Decision Criteria

**Venture Mode:**
- Does this enable 10x market potential?
- Does this create defensible moat?
- Can this scale to millions of users?
- Is this fundable/venture-backable?
- Does this advance strategic positioning?

**Bootstrap Mode:**
- Can we monetize this in weeks (not months)?
- Is procurement simple (credit card vs RFP)?
- Is there existing budget line for this?
- Can we measure direct ROI immediately?
- What's the profit margin?

### Thread Execution

**Venture Mode:**
- Longer decision cycles acceptable
- Strategic value weighted heavily
- Innovation prioritized over profit
- Learning loops focus on product-market fit

**Bootstrap Mode:**
- Fast decision cycles required
- Revenue impact weighted heavily
- Profit prioritized over innovation
- Learning loops focus on monetization

### Canvas Hypotheses

**Venture Mode:**
- Focus: Market size, growth, scalability
- Validation: User metrics, engagement, retention
- Timeline: Quarterly, annual projections

**Bootstrap Mode:**
- Focus: Monetization, margins, cash flow
- Validation: Revenue, profit, customer willingness to pay
- Timeline: Weekly, monthly actuals

## Mode Selection Guide

### Choose VENTURE if:
- You have raised or plan to raise funding
- Market requires scale to win (winner-take-all)
- Building platform/network effects
- Timeline: 7-10 years to exit
- Capital intensive (hardware, compliance, etc.)
- Okay with burn for growth

### Choose BOOTSTRAP if:
- Self-funded, need profitability fast
- Can win without scale (service, niche)
- Building clear solution to known problem
- Timeline: Cash flow now, exit optional
- Capital efficient (software, services)
- Must be profitable from start

### Choose HYBRID if:
- Want to prove PMF before raising
- Bootstrap validates, venture scales
- Reduce risk before taking funding
- Timeline: Bootstrap 6-12mo, then raise
- Option to stay bootstrapped if profitable

## Mode Switching

**Bootstrap → Venture:**
- Trigger: Raised funding, market requires scale
- Action: Update mode, recalculate impact scores, shift metrics
- Canvas: Update assumptions from profit to growth focus

**Venture → Bootstrap:**
- Trigger: Funding dried up, need profitability
- Action: Cut burn, focus on monetization, simplify product
- Canvas: Update assumptions from growth to profit focus

**Bootstrap → Hybrid:**
- Trigger: Profitable but see scale opportunity
- Action: Prepare for funding, maintain profitability
- Canvas: Track both metrics sets
