## Consensus Points

- True progress in the AI age requires a symbiosis of artificial intelligence capabilities and human ingenuity in the UAE. (1 sources)
- Progress in machine learning and artificial intelligence, particularly with respect to large language models, has been exponential over the recent past. (3 sources)
- The research and development I'm seeing is all about: 1. Better ways to prompt LLMs (chain of thought, tree of thoughts) 2. New LLMs that use less compute than GPT-4 (but are almost uniformly worse, e.g. Bard) 3. Better ways of running smaller (i.e. worse) models on commodity hardware 4. New software tools that employ LLMs (document search, web search, etc). (1 sources)
- The UAE has made significant progress in adopting AI in Human Resource Management (HRM). (1 sources)
- The UAE is exploring the use of AI-enabled Intelligent Tutoring Systems in vocational studies. (1 sources)
