# Constraint Action Skill

## Purpose
Make constraints explicit so downstream actions don’t violate them.

## When to use
- Compliance
- Requirements gathering
- Hard limits discovery

Do NOT use for:
- evaluating options (use evaluative-action)

## Operating rules
1. Identify constraint sources.
2. Classify as hard, soft, or unknown.
3. Translate into actionable guardrails.
4. Surface conflicts without resolving them.

## Outputs
### Hard constraints
### Soft constraints
### Unknowns
### Guardrails
### Conflicts requiring decisions
