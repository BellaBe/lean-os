# Demo Template

**Action Type:** `sales:demo`

## Objective
Demonstrate product capabilities and validate solution fit for prospect's use cases.

## Pre-requisites
- Qualification completed (use cases identified)
- Demo environment prepared
- Prospect stakeholders confirmed

## Process

### 1. Demo Preparation (AI-assisted, 2-3 days)

**Environment Setup:**
- [ ] Custom demo environment ({premium tier} if requested)
- [ ] Sample data relevant to prospect's industry
- [ ] 3+ use cases prepared (based on qualification)

**Prep Brief (AI-generated):**
- Prospect profile (company, pain points, decision criteria)
- Use cases to demo (prioritized by prospect needs)
- Potential objections and responses
- Success criteria (what needs to happen for demo to be successful)

**Calendar:**
- [ ] Demo call scheduled (45-60 min)
- [ ] Technical stakeholders invited
- [ ] Agenda sent 24 hours prior

### 2. Demo Call (Human-conducted, 45-60 min)

**Agenda:**
- Introduction & recap (5 min)
- Use case demos (30 min)
- Technical Q&A (15 min)
- Next steps (5 min)

**Demo Flow:**

**Use Case 1 (15 min):**
- Problem statement (prospect's words)
- Current solution (their pain)
- Our solution (live demo)
- Results (metrics, outcomes)

**Use Case 2 (10 min):**
- Repeat pattern

**Use Case 3 (5 min):**
- Quick walkthrough (if time)

**Technical Q&A (15 min):**
- Address technical concerns
- Integration requirements
- Performance metrics (latency, accuracy, scale)
- Security/compliance questions

### 3. Demo Validation Checklist

**Must achieve (to proceed to pilot):**
- [ ] All 3 use cases demonstrated
- [ ] Technical questions answered
- [ ] Stakeholders engaged (asking questions)
- [ ] Clear next step agreed (pilot or direct contract)

### 4. Demo Decision

**INTERESTED:** Stakeholders engaged, pilot requested
→ Proceed to pilot action

**NOT_INTERESTED:** Low engagement, no next step
→ Skip to results (deal lost)

**NEEDS_REVISION:** Engaged but needs different approach
→ Reschedule demo with revised approach

### 5. Post-Demo (AI-automated)
- Send demo recording + technical docs
- Send pilot proposal (if interested)
- Update CRM with demo outcome
- Generate pilot prep brief (if proceeding)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Demo call completed
- [ ] All use cases demonstrated
- [ ] Technical questions answered
- [ ] Stakeholder engagement (3+ questions asked)
- [ ] Next step agreed (pilot or contract)

## AI Automation
- Demo environment setup ({premium tier} branding)
- Pre-demo brief generation
- Calendar scheduling with agenda
- Demo recording and sharing
- Pilot proposal generation
- CRM updates

## Human Touch Points
- **Demo call** (45-60 min)
- **Technical Q&A** (handling objections)
- **Next step negotiation** (pilot terms or contract)

- [ ] Revised demo scheduled: {date} (if needs revision)

## Notes
{Key insights, unexpected questions, opportunities}
```

## Typical Duration
**5-7 days** (prep + demo + follow-up)

## Cost
**~$800** (4 hours @ $200/hr: 2hr prep + 1hr demo + 1hr follow-up)

## Demo Best Practices

**DO:**
- Start with prospect's problem (their words)
- Show, don't tell (live demo, not slides)
- Use their data (or data like theirs)
- Leave time for questions (15+ min)
- Focus on outcomes (metrics, ROI)

**DON'T:**
- Feature dump (show everything)
- Use generic demo data (irrelevant)
- Rush through use cases
- Ignore questions (defer to later)
- End without clear next step

## Red Flags
- Low engagement (no questions)
- Only junior stakeholders attend
- Keeps comparing to competitors
- Wants proposal "to think about it"
- Timeline pushed out (>3 months)

## Green Flags
- Technical questions (deep dive)
- Decision maker engaged
- Asks about pilot immediately
- Discusses integration requirements
- Shares internal use cases
