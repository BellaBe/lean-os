## Attention & Memory

### Distinctiveness (Von Restorff Effect)

What's different gets noticed and remembered. In a sea of sameness, distinctive stands out.

**The B2B Sameness Problem:**
- Every company: "We help you [verb] your [noun]"
- Every email: "I hope this finds you well"
- Every landing page: Stock photos of happy people
- Result: Everything is forgettable

**Four Types of Distinctiveness:**

| Type | Description | Application |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Visual | Look different | Bold colors, break category conventions, unexpected imagery |
| Tonal | Sound different | Distinctive voice, contrarian positions, humor where appropriate |
| Behavioral | Act different | Unexpected outreach, different sales process, delightful surprises |
| Narrative | Tell different story | Distinctive founding story, category of one, unique POV |

**Sameness Audit Exercise:**
1. List your competitors
2. List their messaging
3. List your messaging
4. Identify what's same
5. Change what's same

**Distinctiveness Injection Examples:**
- Standard: "I'd love to schedule a call to discuss..."
- Distinctive: "I have a controversial take on [problem]. 15 minutes to debate?"
- Standard: "The #1 [category] solution"
- Distinctive: "[Unexpected claim that makes them think]"

**Memorability Techniques:**
- Bizarreness: Strange things are remembered ("faster than a caffeinated cheetah")
- Emotion: Emotional experiences stick (surprise, delight, challenge)
- Concreteness: Specific > abstract (vivid imagery, tangible comparisons)
- Stories: Narratives remembered better than facts

### Mere Exposure Effect
Familiarity breeds liking.
- Study: Repeated exposure increases preference
- Apply: Same creative becomes MORE effective over time
- Warning: Only works for neutral-to-positive first impressions

### Zeigarnik Effect
Incomplete tasks remembered better.
- Study: Interrupted tasks +90% recall
- Apply: Open loops in content, cliffhangers in sequences
- Example: "The secret that doubled revenue..." (complete at CTA)

### Information Gap (Curiosity)
Knowing something exists but not what creates pull.
- Study: Partial reveals substantially increase clicks
- Apply: Subject lines, headlines that hint
- Warning: Must eventually satisfy or trust erodes

### Pareidolia
Face-like patterns grab attention automatically.
- Apply: Face elements in packaging, ads, UI
- Works even with abstract face-like shapes

---

## Perception & Judgment

### Expectation Assimilation
We experience what we expect.
- Study: "Unhealthy" food label +55% taste rating
- Apply: Frame by appeal, not virtue; set positive expectations
- Example: Kraft revealed healthy reformulation 3 months after change

### Processing Fluency
Easy to process = feels true and good.
- Study: High contrast text rated more true
- Apply: Simple language, clean design, readable fonts, easy names

### Keats Heuristic
Rhymes feel truer.
- Study: Rhyming proverbs +17% perceived truth
- Apply: Slogans, headlines (sparingly, naturally)
- Example: "Once you pop, you can't stop"

### Illusion of Effort
Perceived effort = quality proxy.
- Study: Poem rated +90% more valuable when told 18hrs vs 4hrs
- Apply: Communicate process, iterations, expertise
- Example: Dyson's "5,127 prototypes"

### AI Devaluation
AI label triggers low-effort assumption.
- Study: AI-labeled art -48% creativity rating
- Apply: Emphasize human curation when using AI

### Operational Transparency
Showing work increases satisfaction.
- Study: Visible kitchen +20% food satisfaction
- Apply: Progress bars, "searching 1,247 options...", open processes

---

## Pricing & Value

### Anchoring (Core Mechanic)
First number shapes all subsequent judgments. We adjust insufficiently from anchors.

**Price Anchoring Tactics:**

| Tactic | Structure | Example |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Anchor to Value | Big outcome → Your price | "This generates $500K pipeline. Investment: $50K." |
| Anchor to Alternative | Expensive option → Your price | "Hiring costs $150K/yr. We cost $500/mo." |
| Anchor to Problem | Cost of problem → Your price | "This problem costs you $50K/yr. Fix it for $5K." |
| Anchor to Competitor | Their price → Your value | "They charge $X for less. We include Y for same price." |

**Metric Anchoring:**
- High anchor for results: "Some see 10x ROI. Average is 3x. Minimum is 1.5x." (1.5x seems acceptable)
- Low anchor for effort: "Most vendors take 6 months. We go live in 2 weeks." (2 weeks seems amazing)

**Negotiation Anchoring:**
- Present highest tier first
- Open with full price before discounts
- Discuss value before discussing cost
- Re-anchor when losing: shift to different metric (TCO, time-to-value)

**Implementation:**
- Pricing pages: Show enterprise tier first, or annual price first
- Outbound: Lead with big outcome number in subject line
- Sales calls: Quantify cost of problem in discovery BEFORE pricing
- Proposals: Value delivered first, then investment

### Choice Architecture

How choices are presented dramatically affects decisions. Defaults, ordering, and framing shape behavior.

**Default Effect:**
- Insight: People stick with defaults
- Application: Make desired action the default
- Examples:
  - Pre-select recommended pricing plan
  - Annual as default with monthly option
  - Optimal settings pre-configured

**Choice Overload:**
- Insight: Too many options causes paralysis
- Application: Reduce choice to increase action
- Rules:
  - 3 pricing tiers maximum
  - Clear differentiation between options
  - Obvious recommendation highlighted
  - Progressive disclosure for complexity

**Ordering Effect:**
- Primacy: First item remembered
- Recency: Last item remembered
- Middle: Often skipped
- Application: Put best option first or last, never bury in middle

**Opt-in vs Opt-out:**
- Opt-out has higher participation
- "Check to NOT receive" vs "Check to receive"
- Same choice, different frame = different behavior

### Decoy Effect
Dominated option shifts preference.
- Study: Decoy shifted preference by 52 percentage points
- Apply: Add asymmetrically dominated third option
- Structure: Low (limited) → Target (full value) → High (anchor)

**Decoy Example:**
| Without Decoy | With Decoy |
|---------------|------------|
| Basic: $10 | Basic: $10 |
| Pro: $25 | Pro Limited: $23 (decoy) |
| Result: 50/50 | Pro: $25 → obvious choice |

### Price Relativity
We judge prices by comparison.
- Apply: Control comparisons, show higher first, never price in isolation

### Charm Pricing
Prices ending in 9 feel cheaper.
- Apply: $99 for value, $100 for premium (context matters)

### Round Number Pricing
Round = premium; precise = value.
- Apply: $1,000 for luxury, $997 for deals

### Temporal Reframing
Smaller time units = smaller perceived price.
- Study: $1/day +53% agreement vs $350/year
- Apply: Show per-day/week cost, installments
- Example: "$4.57/day - less than a coffee"

### Anchoring via Limits
Purchase limits become quantity reference.
- Study: "Limit 12" increased purchases from 3.3 to 7
- Apply: "Limit 4 per customer" increases purchase

---

## Motivation & Action

### Commitment & Consistency

Once people commit to something, they feel compelled to be consistent with it. Small commitments lead to larger commitments.

**Mechanics:**
- Cognitive dissonance: We hate inconsistency between actions and beliefs
- Self-perception: "If I did X, I must be the kind of person who does X"
- Public commitment: Public > private (harder to back out)

**Micro-Commitment Ladder:**
1. Answer a question (tiny yes)
2. Download content
3. Attend webinar
4. Take a meeting
5. Start trial
6. Expand usage
7. Purchase
8. Expand contract

**Implementation:**
- Landing pages: Quiz before content, "Which describes you?" selector
- Outbound: Ask easy question first ("Quick question—does this resonate?")
- Sales: "Does this make sense so far?" → document their yeses
- Close: "You mentioned this was important..." (reference prior commitments)

**Public Commitment Tactics:**
- Product: "Tell your team about your goals"
- Sales: "What will you tell your CEO about this?"
- Marketing: Social sharing of intent

**Identity Commitment:**
- "You're the kind of company that..."
- "Leaders like you..."
- Make product part of identity

### Present Bias
Current costs hurt more than future costs.
- Apply: Defer payment (BNPL), free trials, installments
- Study: 60% chose worse deal to avoid immediate cost

### Sunk Cost Fallacy
Prior investment motivates continued spending.
- Apply: Subscription fees increase engagement, remind of investment
- Study: Full price = +25% attendance vs discounted

**Sunk Cost Leveraging:**
- Time investment: Custom setup, personalized onboarding, their data in system
- Social investment: Team introductions, internal champion
- Financial investment: Small initial purchase, paid pilot

### Illusion of Progress
Pre-filled progress increases completion.
- Study: 12-stamp card with 2 prefilled completed 19% faster
- Apply: Pre-fill onboarding steps, show "2/5 complete"

### Implementation Intentions
If-then plans increase follow-through 3x.
- Study: With plan = 71% completion vs 32%
- Apply: Create specific trigger moments
- Example: Snickers "You're not you when hungry"

### Friction Sensitivity
Tiny friction dramatically reduces behavior.
- Study: Each form field = ~5-10% conversion drop
- Apply: Remove ALL friction from desired path

### Variable Reward Schedule
Uncertain rewards drive more engagement.
- Study: Variable reward = 2x engagement vs guaranteed
- Apply: Randomize rewards slightly, mystery elements

### Near-Win Effect
Almost winning creates stronger response than winning.
- Apply: "You were THIS close", almost-complete progress

### Uncertainty Premium
Chance of great > certainty of good.
- Study: 1-in-3 free = +43% sales vs guaranteed 50c off
- Apply: Lottery promotions beat fixed discounts

### Regret Lottery
Auto-entry + conditional eligibility activates loss aversion.
- Study: Regret lottery = -26% parking violations
- Apply: "You're entered to win - complete profile to be eligible"

## Social & Trust

### Social Proof

We look to others' behavior. "If others are doing it, it must be right."

**Five Types of Social Proof:**

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Numerical | Raw adoption numbers | "Join 50,247 companies using X" |
| Peer | People like me | "Used by 73% of YC companies" |
| Aspirational | People I want to be like | "Trusted by Stripe, Notion, Linear" |
| Dynamic | Real-time activity | "Sarah from Acme just signed up" |
| Implied | Visible usage indicators | Activity feeds, user counts |

**Hierarchy of Proof Strength:**
1. Implied (visible usage) — strongest
2. Specific + relevant ("CTOs like you")
3. Specific numbers ("50,247 companies")
4. Named customers
5. Vague claims ("thousands trust us") — weakest

**Negative Social Proof (Anti-pattern):**
- "Only 5% of companies do X" → implies 95% don't, maybe you shouldn't
- "Most people forget to..." → normalizes forgetting
- Always frame positively: "95% of successful companies do X"

**Implementation by Touchpoint:**
- Subject lines: "[Peer company] just switched to us"
- Landing pages: Logos above fold, testimonials near CTAs
- Sales: Reference similar customers in objection handling
- Product: "Most users start by...", "Popular templates"

### Messenger Effect
Who says it matters as much as what.
- Study: High credibility = 23% persuaded vs 7%
- Apply: Invest in credible messengers, B2B can drive B2C

### Reciprocity

When someone gives us something, we feel obligated to give back. One of the strongest human drives.

**Four Types of Reciprocity:**

| Type | Description | Application |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Value | Give value, receive attention | Free content, tools, insights before asking |
| Personalized | Personalized gifts stronger | "I noticed X about your company..." |
| Concession | When you concede, they concede | Large ask → rejection → smaller ask (door in face) |
| Help | Help given creates obligation | Exceptional support, help beyond your product |

**Value-First Outbound:**
- Email 1: "I noticed X. Here's Y that might help." (NOT "Can we schedule a call?")
- Email 2: "Here's another resource: Z" (NOT "Following up")
- Email 3: "Given the value I've shared, would you be open to..."

**Ungated Content Strategy:**
- Give best content freely
- No email required for value
- They feel obligation → when you ask, they reciprocate

**In Sales:**
- Discovery: "Before we talk about us, let me share something useful..."
- Give insight about their business first
- Help them even if deal doesn't close

### Framing Effects

How you present information matters more than the information itself. Same facts, different frame = different decision.

**Gain vs Loss Framing:**
- Loss framing is 2x more powerful
- Gain: "Save $10,000 per year"
- Loss: "Stop losing $10,000 per year" ← typically wins
- When to use loss: motivating action, creating urgency
- When to use gain: building aspiration, when loss feels manipulative

**Concrete vs Abstract:**
- Concrete is more persuasive
- Abstract: "Improve productivity"
- Concrete: "Save 5 hours per week" ← always prefer

**Relative vs Absolute:**
- Use whichever sounds more impressive
- Absolute: "Save $1,000" vs Relative: "Save 50%"
- Absolute: "200 new customers" vs Relative: "3x growth"

**Message Optimization Process:**
1. Identify key claim
2. Generate multiple frames (gain/loss, concrete/abstract, relative/absolute)
3. Select most impactful
4. Test alternatives

**Example Claim: "Our tool saves time"**
- Gain concrete: "Save 10 hours per week"
- Loss concrete: "Stop wasting 10 hours per week"
- Gain relative: "50% faster than manual"
- Loss relative: "You're 50% slower than competitors using this"
- Test top 3, measure response

### Indulgent Framing
Indulgent descriptions outperform health claims.
- Study: Indulgent labels +25% sales; health labels -7%
- Apply: Lead with desirability, not duty

### Future Self Bias
People choose "should" for future, "want" for now.
- Apply: Healthy/premium for planned; indulgence for impulse

---

## Sensory & Environmental

### Synesthesia (Cross-Sensory)
Perception in one sense influences another.
- Study: Louder crunch = +15% freshness perception
- Apply: Engineer product sounds, package opening

### Sound Symbolism
Word sounds carry meaning.
- Apply: Front vowels (i, e) for small/fast; back (o, u) for big/slow

### Weight = Quality
Heavier = higher quality perception.
- Study: Heavy cutlery +12% food rating
- Apply: Add weight for premium signal

### Music = Spending
Classical music increases WTP.
- Study: Classical: $33 spend vs pop: $29
- Apply: Match music to positioning

---

## Time & Scarcity

### Scarcity/Urgency

People value things more when they're scarce. Loss aversion makes us hate losing more than we like gaining.

**Four Types of Scarcity:**

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Quantity | Limited availability | "Only 3 spots left at this price" |
| Time | Limited window | "Offer expires Friday at 5pm" |
| Access | Exclusive entry | "Invite only", "Founders-only pricing" |
| Information | Exclusive knowledge | "Insider tips most don't know" |

**Psychological Mechanics:**
- Loss aversion: Losses feel 2x as painful as gains ("Don't miss out" > "Get access")
- Reactance: When freedom threatened, we want it more
- FOMO: Fear of missing what others have

**Authenticity Requirement:**
- Must be real scarcity
- Fake scarcity destroys trust permanently
- If manufactured, be transparent about why

**Implementation:**
- Pricing: Early bird tiers, price increase deadlines
- Outbound: "Closing your file Friday"
- Landing pages: Countdown timer, spots remaining
- Sales: "This pricing available until end of quarter"

**Ethical Guidelines:**
- Create legitimate scarcity: implementation capacity, genuine price increases, real deadlines
- Short-term gain from fake scarcity = long-term trust destruction

### False Scarcity
Artificial limits signal value.
- Study: Purchase limit increased sales 56%
- Apply: Use sparingly and plausibly

### Habituation
Continuous exposure dulls pleasure.
- Study: Massage with break > longer continuous
- Apply: Remove products before habituation, seasonal offerings

### Nostalgia
Increases WTP and reduces price sensitivity.
- Study: Nostalgic priming tripled WTP
- Apply: Retro aesthetics, heritage messaging

---

## Disclosure & Timing

### Disclosure Timing
Negative info after experience preserves perception.
- Study: Told about ingredient after = 52% liked; before = 30%
- Apply: Reveal downsides post-trial

### Peak-End Rule

Experiences judged by peak (most intense point) and end. Everything in between is largely forgotten.

**Key Insight:**
- Mediocre experience with great peak + end > consistent good experience
- Bad ending ruins great experience
- Forgettable middle is fine

**Journey Design:**

| Journey | Peak | End | Design |
|---------|------|-----|--------|
| Sales call | Aha moment in demo | Exciting next steps | Save wow for demo, end with vision not logistics |
| Onboarding | First success | Celebration | Engineer early win, celebrate completion |
| Support | Problem solved | Positive close | Resolve completely, add value at end |
| Email sequence | Value bomb (Email 2-3) | Memorable close | Not sad breakup, leave door open positively |

**Meeting Design (Peak-End Optimized):**
1. Quick intros (don't linger)
2. Discovery
3. Demo = PEAK (the wow moment)
4. Vision of success
5. Inspiring call to action = END (not boring admin)

**Content Design:**
- Blog: Build to peak insight, end with actionable memorable close (not "in conclusion" rehash)
- Webinar: Save best for late, end with bang not Q&A fade

### Timing & Context Effects

The same message at different times has different effectiveness. When and where matter as much as what.

**Fresh Start Effect:**
- People more receptive at temporal landmarks
- Landmarks: New year, new quarter, Monday, after vacation, after funding
- Application: "New quarter, new approach?"

**Depletion Effect:**
- Decision quality degrades with fatigue
- Morning for complex decisions
- Avoid end-of-day asks, Friday afternoon proposals

**Mood Effect:**
- Good news context improves receptivity
- After success: ask for referral
- After problem solved: ask for review
- Avoid: layoff announcements, bad quarter timing

**Cognitive Load Effect:**
- Simple messages when busy
- Complex messages when focused
- Reduce friction when overloaded

**Optimal Send Times (B2B Email):**
- Best days: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
- Best times: 9-11am, 1-3pm (recipient timezone)
- Worst: Monday morning, Friday afternoon

**Context Adaptation:**
- Mobile: Shorter, scannable
- Desktop: Can be longer
- Evening: More casual
- Business hours: More professional

**Sequential Context:**
- After content download: Acknowledge topic
- After support resolution: Reference solution
- After milestone: Celebrate and build

---

## Bias Combinations

**Strong combinations:**
- Loss Aversion + Scarcity = loss of opportunity
- Concrete Language + Social Proof = believable proof
- Illusion of Effort + Premium Pricing = justified value
- Curiosity + Zeigarnik = compounding hooks
- Present Bias + Temporal Reframe = future costs feel smaller

**Potential conflicts:**
- Scarcity + Trust Building (false scarcity damages trust)
- Multiple CTAs + Friction Reduction (competing = friction)
- Heavy discounting + Premium positioning (signals cheap)

**Rule:** Max 4-5 biases per piece.
