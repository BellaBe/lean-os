# Outbound Behavioral Playbook

Deep implementation guide for applying behavioral science to outbound sequences.

---

## The Behavioral Outbound Framework

Traditional outbound: Pitch -> Pitch harder -> Break up
Behavioral outbound: Earn attention -> Build reciprocity -> Create commitment -> Close

---

## Email 1: Distinctiveness + Curiosity

**Goal:** Get opened and read (attention)

### Subject Line

**Not this:** "Quick question about your marketing"
**But this:** "The $500k mistake I see Series B companies make"

Formula options:
- Curiosity: "[Unexpected insight] about [their problem]"
- Loss: "The [amount] you're leaving on the table"
- Peer: "[Similar company] just changed their approach"
- Pattern break: "Ignore everything you know about [topic]"

### Opening

**Not this:** "I hope this finds you well"
**But this:** Start with the insight immediately

The first line must earn the second line. No warmup.

### Body Structure

```
[Hook - curiosity or loss frame]

[Value - give insight related to their situation]

[Proof - how peer company experienced this]

[Micro-commitment question - not a meeting request]
```

### CTA

**Not this:** "Can we schedule a call?"
**But this:** "Is this even on your radar? (just hit reply)"

Psychology: Micro-commitment + low friction. A reply is easier than a meeting.

## Email 2: Reciprocity + Social Proof

**Timing:** 3 days later, Tuesday or Wednesday 10am

**Goal:** Build reciprocity, deepen interest

### Structure

```
[Acknowledge no response is fine]

[Give something valuable - resource, insight, data]

[Peer story - case study or example]

[Soft positioning - "thought this might help"]
```

**Not this:** "Just following up on my previous email"
**But this:** "Regardless of whether we talk, this might be useful:"

Psychology: Pure reciprocity. No ask yet. You're giving before asking.

---

## Email 3: Scarcity + Loss Aversion

**Timing:** 5 days later, Wednesday 9am

**Goal:** Create urgency to act

### Structure

```
[Reference previous value given]

[Scarcity element - limited spots, deadline, etc.]

[Loss frame - what they're losing by waiting]

[Direct ask - but reasonable]
```

### Scarcity Rules

**Must be real.** Options:
- Limited implementation capacity
- Price increase date
- Event/cohort deadline
- Beta access closing

**Never fake.** Discovered fake scarcity = permanent trust loss.

### Loss Framing

Calculate the cost of inaction:
- "Every week you wait = $X lost"
- "Your competitors are already [action]"
- "This problem compounds at [rate]"

---

## Email 4: Commitment + Consistency

**Timing:** 7 days later, Thursday 10am

**Goal:** Leverage any engagement signals

### If They Engaged (opens, clicks, partial reply)

```
[Reference their action]

"Since you [opened/clicked/started to reply], I'm guessing this resonates..."

[Ask that's consistent with their action]
```

Psychology: People want to be consistent with their behavior.

### If No Engagement

```
[Final value piece]

[Clear, direct ask]

[Easy exit option]
```

"If this isn't relevant, just reply 'pass' and I'll stop reaching out."

---

## Email 5: Peak-End Rule

**Timing:** 10 days later, Tuesday 10am

**Goal:** Leave memorable positive impression

### Not This: Sad Breakup

"I guess this isn't a priority... I'll stop reaching out... wishing you the best..."

This ends on a whimper. They'll remember the whimper.

### But This: Memorable End

**Option A - Humor (if appropriate for brand):**
"This is my last email. I thought about writing something sad about how I'll miss you, but instead: here's [genuinely useful resource]. Use it even if we never talk."

**Option B - Value bomb:**
Save your best content for last. "Whether or not we connect, this is the most valuable thing I can share about [topic]:"

**Option C - Direct/respectful:**
"I've reached out a few times without hearing back. I respect that you're busy. If [specific trigger event] ever happens, I'd still love to connect. [Door open]."

**Option D - Creative/distinctive:**
Something unexpected that they'll remember.

Psychology: The ending determines how they remember the entire sequence.

## Subject Line Formulas

### Curiosity Formulas
- "The [counterintuitive insight] about [topic]"
- "[Company]'s surprising approach to [problem]"
- "Why [common belief] might be wrong"
- "What [respected company] knows that you don't"

### Loss Formulas
- "The [amount] you're leaving on the table"
- "Stop losing [outcome] to [problem]"
- "Why [problem] is worse than you think"
- "[Company]'s [problem] is costing them [amount]"

### Social Proof Formulas
- "[Peer company] just changed their [topic] approach"
- "[Number] companies made this switch last month"
- "How [similar company] fixed [problem]"

### Distinctiveness Formulas
- "[Unexpected analogy] for [topic]"
- "Ignore everything you know about [topic]"
- "The [topic] strategy no one talks about"

### Personalization Formulas
- "[Their specific thing] caught my attention"
- "Saw your [content/post/announcement]—question"
- "Re: [something specific to them]"

## Timing Optimization

### Best Send Times (B2B Email)
- **Days:** Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
- **Times:** 9-11am OR 1-3pm (recipient timezone)
- **Worst:** Monday morning, Friday afternoon

### Fresh Start Targeting
- New year campaigns
- New quarter outreach
- Monday morning sends
- Post-funding (Series announcement)
- New role (promotion detected)

### Avoid
- Right after major market news (distracted)
- During their known busy periods
- Holiday weeks
- End of their fiscal quarters (if known)

---

## Personalization Layers

### Level 1: Basic
- Name, company, industry

### Level 2: Research
- Recent news about company
- Their content (posts, podcasts)
- Tech stack signals

### Level 3: Insight
- Specific observation about their situation
- Custom analysis or value
- Mutual connection context

**Rule:** Level 3 personalization triggers strongest reciprocity, but doesn't scale. Use for high-value targets.

## A/B Testing Framework

### Subject Line Tests
- Curiosity vs Loss frame
- With company name vs without
- Question vs statement
- Length (short vs medium)

### Body Tests
- Value-first vs problem-first
- With social proof vs without
- Question CTA vs statement CTA
- Short vs medium length

### Sequence Tests
- 5-email vs 7-email
- Spacing (3-day vs 5-day)
- Different ending approaches

---

## Measurement

### Key Metrics
- Open rate by subject formula
- Reply rate by email number
- Positive reply rate
- Meeting conversion rate

### Behavioral Attribution
- Which biases correlate with responses?
- Which sequence position performs best?
- What personalization level works for which segment?

### Feedback Loop
1. Hypothesis: "Bias X works for persona Y"
2. Test: A/B in sequence
3. Learn: Measure result
4. Update: Refine approach
5. Repeat
