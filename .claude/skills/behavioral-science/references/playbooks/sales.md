# Sales Conversation Behavioral Playbook

Deep implementation guide for applying behavioral science to sales conversations.

## The Behavioral Sales Framework

Traditional sales: Present -> Overcome objections -> Close
Behavioral sales: Build commitment ladder -> Anchor value -> Leverage consistency -> Close

## Discovery Call

### Opening

**Job:** Break pattern, establish credibility, create curiosity

**Primary Biases:** Distinctiveness, Curiosity

**Not this:** "Thanks for taking the time. Tell me about your business."
**But this:** "I have a hypothesis about your [problem area]. Mind if I test it?"

**Alternative openings:**
- "Before we talk about us, I noticed something interesting about [their situation]..."
- "I'm going to skip the pleasantries and start with something that might surprise you..."
- "I've been looking at companies like yours and I have a theory. Can I share it?"

**Psychology:** Pattern interrupt + positions you as expert with insight.

### Problem Exploration

**Job:** Get them to articulate pain (they convince themselves)

**Primary Biases:** Loss Framing, Commitment

**Question Sequence:**

| Question | Bias | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| "What's this problem costing you?" | Loss framing | Quantify the loss |
| "What happens if nothing changes?" | Loss framing | Future-pace the pain |
| "What have you tried before?" | Anchoring | Set high anchor |
| "Why didn't that work?" | -- | Understand objections |
| "Is solving this a priority?" | Commitment | Get verbal yes |

**Technique:** Let them do the talking. Their words are more persuasive than yours.

**Document their statements:** "You mentioned this was costing you $X" - you'll use this later.

### Anchor Setting

**Job:** Establish high reference point before your price

**Primary Bias:** Anchoring

**Questions to ask:**
- "What have you tried before? What did that cost?"
- "What are you considering as alternatives?"
- "What would it cost to solve this with a hire?"
- "What's the cost of doing nothing for another year?"

**Psychology:** Their alternatives and the cost of inaction become the anchor. Your price is judged against this anchor, not in isolation.

## Demo

### Peak Engineering

**Job:** Create a memorable wow moment

**Primary Bias:** Peak-End Rule

**Structure:**
```
[Build up] Context for the wow moment
[Peak] The aha moment
[Reinforce] "This is where [peer company] saw the biggest impact"
[End strong] Vision, not logistics
```

**Planning the peak:**
- What's the single most impressive thing you can show?
- What will make them say "wow" or "I didn't know that was possible"?
- Build toward this moment, don't lead with it

### Social Proof Integration

**Job:** Validate during evaluation

**Primary Bias:** Social Proof

**Phrases to weave in:**
- "This is where [similar company] saw the biggest impact"
- "Companies like yours typically use this for [outcome]"
- "Your competitors like [company] are already doing this"
- "Teams your size usually [behavior]"

**When to use:** At moments of potential doubt or when showing key features.

### Commitment Building

**Job:** Build ladder of yeses throughout

**Primary Bias:** Commitment/Consistency

**Phrases to use:**
- "Does this make sense so far?"
- "Can you see how this would solve [problem they mentioned]?"
- "Is this addressing what you described earlier?"
- "What would this mean for your team?"

**Document every yes:** You'll reference these in proposal and negotiation.

## Proposal

### Value Anchoring

**Job:** Make price feel reasonable

**Primary Bias:** Anchoring

**Document Structure:**
```
1. VALUE DELIVERED (First)
   "[Expected outcome] based on similar customers"
   "[ROI calculation] = $X value"

2. THEIR SITUATION (Reference their words)
   "You mentioned [problem] was costing you $Y"
   "Your goal was to [outcome they stated]"

3. INVESTMENT (After value established)
   "Investment: $Z"
   "ROI: [X]x return in first year"
```

**Never present price without establishing value anchor first.**

### Choice Architecture

**Job:** Guide to optimal choice without paralysis

**Primary Biases:** Choice Architecture, Decoy Effect

**Structure:**
```
Option A: [Limited scope] - $X
Option B: [Full solution] - $Y <- Recommended
Option C: [Premium/Enterprise] - $Z
```

**Decoy logic:** Option A should be limited enough that B is obviously better value. Option C anchors high.

**Presentation order:** Some present high-to-low (anchoring), others highlight B (guide to target). Test both.

## Negotiation

### Reciprocity in Concessions

**Job:** Every give gets a get

**Primary Biases:** Reciprocity, Concession Reciprocity

**Structure:**
- "I can do X if you can do Y"
- "If I reduce the price by Z, can we sign this week?"
- "I can include [bonus] if you can [commitment]"

**Make concessions feel valuable:**
- "This isn't something we usually do, but..."
- "I had to get approval for this..."
- "Let me see what I can do..."

### Loss Framing for Action

**Job:** Motivate decision

**Primary Bias:** Loss Aversion

**Phrases:**
- "Every week you wait, you're losing [outcome calculated earlier]"
- "The cost of doing nothing is [amount from discovery]"
- "What happens if this slips to next quarter?"
- "Your competitors aren't waiting..."

**Use their words:** "You mentioned this problem was costing you $X per month. That means waiting another month costs you $X."

### Commitment Leverage

**Job:** Hold them to prior statements

**Primary Bias:** Commitment/Consistency

**Phrases:**
- "You mentioned [priority] was important to you..."
- "Given what you said about [problem]..."
- "Earlier you agreed this would [outcome]..."
- "When we talked about [topic], you said..."

**This is why you document throughout:** Prior commitments become closing tools.

## Closing

### Legitimate Scarcity

**Job:** Create urgency to decide

**Primary Bias:** Scarcity

**Only when real:**
- "This pricing is only available until [date]"
- "Implementation slots fill up - next available is [date]"
- "This offer expires [date]"
- "We're raising prices [date]"

**Never fake scarcity.** If discovered, deal dies and reputation suffers.

### Strong Ending

**Job:** Leave positive impression regardless of outcome

**Primary Bias:** Peak-End Rule

**Close with vision, not logistics:**

**Not this:** "So next steps would be getting the contract signed, then we'd schedule implementation, and you'd need to provide access to..."

**But this:** "Picture this: 90 days from now, you're looking at a dashboard showing [outcome]. Your team has [benefit]. [Pain point] is behind you. That's what we're going to build together."

**Then logistics:** "Here's how we get there..."

**If deal doesn't close:** Still end strong. "I respect your decision. If [trigger event] ever changes this, I'd love to reconnect. In the meantime, [offer something valuable]."

## Objection Handling

### "Too Expensive"

**Biases:** Anchoring, Temporal Reframing, Loss Aversion

**Responses:**
- Anchor: "Compared to [alternative they mentioned], this is [X]% less"
- Temporal: "That's $X per day - less than [relatable comparison]"
- Loss: "The cost of the problem is [Y] per month. This is [fraction] of that."
- ROI: "Based on [similar company], you'd see [return] - that's [X]x ROI."

### "Need to think about it"

**Biases:** Commitment, Scarcity, Loss

**Responses:**
- Commitment: "What specifically do you need to think about?"
- Scarcity: "I understand. Just so you know, [deadline/capacity] means [consequence]"
- Loss: "While you're thinking, [cost of delay]"
- Clarity: "Is there something I haven't addressed?"

### "Need to talk to [other person]"

**Biases:** Commitment, Social Proof

**Responses:**
- Commitment: "What will you tell them about this?"
- Enable: "What would help you make the case? Can I provide [material]?"
- Social proof: "When [similar company] presented this, they highlighted [X]"
- Offer: "Would it help if I joined that conversation?"

### "Competitor is cheaper"

**Biases:** Anchoring, Loss Aversion

**Responses:**
- Reframe: "Let's look at total cost of ownership..."
- Loss: "What's the cost if [cheaper solution] doesn't work?"
- Proof: "Companies who chose [competitor] and then switched to us..."
- Anchor: "Compared to [their problem cost], both options are small..."

## Behavioral Signals to Watch

### High Buying Signals

| Signal | What it Means | How to Respond |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Future questions ("How would we...") | Visualizing ownership | Encourage, close |
| Involving others | Building consensus | Provide enablement |
| Specific objections | Taking seriously | Address directly |
| Asking about timeline | Ready to act | Provide path |

### Warning Signals

| Signal | What it Means | How to Respond |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Vague responses | Not engaged | Probe for real concerns |
| Time pressure | Brush-off | Qualify harder |
| "Interesting" | Polite disinterest | Challenge directly |
| Asking for written info | Delaying | Understand why |

## Meeting Structure

### Optimal Timing

**Best:** Morning slots (decision fatigue lower)
**Avoid:** Right before lunch, end of day, Friday afternoon

### Structure for Peak-End

```
Opening: 5 min - Pattern interrupt, establish value
Discovery: 15 min - Build commitment ladder
Demo: 20 min - Build to peak moment
Proposal/Next: 10 min - End with vision
```

**Note:** Peak happens in demo, not at end. End is vision/action, not logistics.

### Post-Meeting Follow-up

**Same day.** Reinforces peak, maintains momentum.

**Structure:**
- Reference the peak moment
- Summarize their commitments (their words)
- Clear next step
- Vision of success

**Not this:** "Thanks for your time today. Attached is the info we discussed."
**But this:** "When I showed you [peak moment], you said [their reaction]. That's exactly what [similar company] experienced before [outcome]. Here's what we do next..."
