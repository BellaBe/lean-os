# Ads Behavioral Playbook

Deep implementation guide for applying behavioral science to paid advertising.

---

## The Behavioral Ads Framework

You have 1-3 seconds. Every word must work. Every visual must stop the scroll.

Traditional ads: Feature → Benefit → CTA
Behavioral ads: Pattern interrupt → Emotional hook → Single action

---

## Social Ads (Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram)

### Template 1: Hook-Problem-Solution

**Structure:**
```
HOOK (First 125 chars - must stop scroll)
↓
PROBLEM (Next 100 chars)
↓
SOLUTION (Next 100 chars)
↓
CTA
```

**Hook Options:**

| Type | Formula | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Loss Frame | "[Stat] [Audience] are losing [thing] every [period]" | "73% of B2B companies lose $50K/year to manual reporting" |
| Curiosity | "The [unexpected thing] that [outcome] (nobody talks about this)" | "The pricing mistake that kills 40% of SaaS deals" |
| Pattern Break | "[Contrarian statement]" | "Stop A/B testing your headlines" |
| Specific Result | "[Number] [outcome] in [timeframe]" | "2,847 demos booked in 90 days" |

**Problem Section:**
- "Still [common painful behavior]? That's costing you [specific amount]."
- "If you're [symptom], you're probably losing [outcome]."
- "[Common approach] is broken. Here's proof:"

**Solution Section:**
- "[Product] [specific outcome] in [timeframe]. [Social proof number] already did."
- "One change. [Specific result]. See how →"

**CTA:**
- "[Action] before [deadline/limit]" (if real scarcity)
- "See how [peer company] did it →"
- "Get the [specific deliverable] →"

---

### Template 2: Testimonial Ad

Best for: Retargeting, trust building, social proof

**Structure:**
```
HOOK: "[Specific result] in [timeframe]" — [Customer Name]

BODY: "I was [relatable problem]. Then I found [Product].
Now I [specific outcome]."

CTA: "Get the same results →"
```

**Testimonial Selection Criteria:**
- Specific numbers (not "great product!")
- Relatable situation (matches target audience)
- Transformation arc (before → after)
- Credible messenger (title, company recognizable)

**Visual:**
- Customer photo/video (Messenger Effect)
- Before/after if applicable
- Specific numbers overlaid on image

---

### Template 3: Curiosity Ad

Best for: Top of funnel, content promotion, lead magnets

**Structure:**
```
HOOK: "[Number] [things] that [surprising outcome]"
OR: "Why [common belief] is wrong"

BODY: "[Tease the insight without revealing]
Most [audience] don't know this..."

CTA: "See all [number] →"
```

**Curiosity Rules:**
- Must eventually satisfy (or trust dies)
- Hint at value, don't give it away
- Create information gap

---

### Template 4: Social Proof Ad

Best for: Consideration stage, competitive markets

**Structure:**
```
HOOK: "Why [X,XXX] [audience] switched to [Product]"
OR: "[Impressive stat] companies use [Product]"

BODY: "[List 2-3 recognizable logos]
[Specific aggregate result]"

CTA: "Join them →"
```

**Social Proof Hierarchy for Ads:**
1. Peer company logos (most effective)
2. Specific numbers with context
3. Named customers with results
4. Aggregate metrics
5. Vague claims (least effective)

---

## Display Ads

### Banner Ad Framework

**Limited space = maximum bias concentration**

| Element | Bias | Implementation |
|---------|------|----------------|
| Headline | Loss or Curiosity | One strong hook |
| Visual | Pareidolia | Face or face-like pattern |
| Number | Concrete Language | Specific stat |
| CTA | Single Action | One clear verb |
| Color | Distinctiveness | Contrast with surroundings |

**Headline Formulas (short):**
- "Stop losing [X]"
- "[Number]% [outcome]"
- "The [thing] [audience] use"
- "[Outcome] in [time]"

---

## Video Ads

### First 3 Seconds

**Job:** Stop the scroll before skip

**Tactics:**
| Bias | Implementation |
|------|----------------|
| Pattern Interrupt | Start mid-action, unexpected visual |
| Pareidolia | Face in frame immediately |
| Curiosity | Intriguing question/statement |
| Loss Frame | "You're losing X right now" |

**NOT:** Logo, brand name, slow build

### Structure for 15-30 Second Ads

```
0-3s: HOOK (pattern interrupt, face, surprising stat)
3-10s: PROBLEM (agitate pain point)
10-20s: SOLUTION (show product/outcome)
20-30s: CTA + PROOF (action + social proof)
```

### Peak-End for Video

- **Peak:** Most impressive visual/claim at ~60% mark
- **End:** Strong CTA, not fade to logo
- People remember peak and ending, not middle

---

## Retargeting Ads

### Cart Abandonment

**Primary Biases:** Loss Aversion, Scarcity

```
HOOK: "Still thinking about [product]?"

BODY: "Your cart is waiting — but not for long.
[Scarcity element if real]"

CTA: "Complete your order →"
```

**Enhancements:**
- Show the actual product image
- Add urgency: "Cart expires in 24 hours"
- Offer: "Complete now, get [bonus]"

### Site Visitor Retargeting

**Primary Biases:** Social Proof, Reciprocity

```
HOOK: "[X] companies like yours chose [Product]"

BODY: "You visited us. Here's what you missed:
[Key benefit they didn't see]"

CTA: "See the full story →"
```

### Content Retargeting

**Primary Biases:** Commitment, Reciprocity

```
HOOK: "Liked [content topic]? There's more."

BODY: "Since you read [content], you might want:
[Related deeper content or product]"

CTA: "Continue learning →"
```

## Ad Creative Guidelines

### Visual Biases

| Bias | Visual Implementation |
|------|----------------------|
| Pareidolia | Face or face-like shapes grab attention |
| Distinctiveness | Break category visual conventions |
| Contrast | CTA button pops from background |
| Concrete | Show outcome, not abstract concept |

### Color Psychology (Use Sparingly)

| Color | Association | Use For |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Red | Urgency, attention | CTAs, sale ads |
| Blue | Trust, calm | B2B, finance |
| Green | Growth, go | Success, eco |
| Orange | Energy, action | CTAs, offers |

**Note:** Distinctiveness > color psychology. Break your category's color conventions.

### Text on Image Rules

- Max 20% text (Facebook policy)
- High contrast (readability)
- One key number or phrase
- Readable on mobile (larger than you think)

---

## Platform-Specific Notes

### LinkedIn Ads

**Audience:** Professional, B2B, higher intent
**Effective Biases:**
- Authority (credentials, company names)
- Social Proof (peer companies)
- Specificity (concrete numbers)

**Less Effective:**
- Heavy emotional appeals
- Consumer-style urgency
- Casual tone

### Facebook/Instagram Ads

**Audience:** Mixed, scroll-heavy, entertainment mode
**Effective Biases:**
- Pattern Interrupt (stop the scroll)
- Curiosity (information gap)
- Social Proof (visible usage)

**Format Notes:**
- Video outperforms static
- Faces increase engagement
- Carousel for multiple products

### Google Display

**Context:** Banner blindness is real
**Effective Biases:**
- Distinctiveness (MUST stand out)
- Pareidolia (face catches eye)
- Single message (no time to read)

---

## A/B Testing Framework

### Priority Tests

1. **Hook type:** Loss vs Curiosity vs Social Proof
2. **Visual:** Face vs product vs abstract
3. **CTA:** Action verb variations
4. **Social proof:** With vs without

### Test One Bias at a Time

**Control:** No explicit bias
**Variant A:** Loss frame hook
**Variant B:** Curiosity hook
**Variant C:** Social proof hook

Measure: CTR, CPC, conversion rate

### Statistical Significance

- Minimum 1,000 impressions per variant
- 95% confidence before declaring winner
- Test duration: At least 7 days (capture day-of-week variance)

---

## Measurement

### Key Metrics by Goal

| Goal | Primary Metric | Secondary |
|------|----------------|-----------|
| Awareness | Reach, Frequency | Brand lift |
| Consideration | CTR, Engagement | Time on site |
| Conversion | CPA, ROAS | Conversion rate |

### Behavioral Attribution

- Which hook type drives highest CTR?
- Which bias combination converts best?
- Which audience segment responds to which bias?
