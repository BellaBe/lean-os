# Peter Kazanjy Founding Sales Methodology

## Core Framework

Founding sales for B2B SaaS startups requires structured, hypothesis-driven approach.

### Sales Stages

1. **Problem Interview** (30-45 min)
   - Goal: Validate pain hypothesis
   - Questions: Current state, pain points, cost of problem
   - Output: Problem validated or hypothesis adjusted

2. **Solution Interview** (45-60 min)
   - Goal: Validate solution fit
   - Demo: Show how we solve their pain
   - Questions: Would this solve it? What's missing?
   - Output: Solution validated or features adjusted

3. **Proposal** 
   - Goal: Economic validation
   - Deliver: Pricing, ROI model, case study
   - Questions: Budget, timeline, approval process
   - Output: Proposal accepted or objections handled

4. **Close**
   - Goal: Win deal
   - Handle: Final objections, legal, procurement
   - Output: Customer or loss analysis

### Persona-Based Messaging

Different stakeholders care about different things:

**Economic Buyer** (approves budget):
- Language: ROI, payback, risk, strategic value
- Concerns: Is this worth the investment?
- Proof: Financial models, case study outcomes

**Technical Buyer** (approves implementation):
- Language: Architecture, integration, security, maintenance
- Concerns: Will this work in our environment?
- Proof: Technical specs, implementation timeline

**End User** (daily user):
- Language: Workflow, ease of use, productivity
- Concerns: Will this make my job easier?
- Proof: Demo, free trial, time savings

### Objection Handling

Address objections BEFORE they arise:

**Common objections**:
- "Too expensive" → Pre-empt with ROI model
- "Not the right time" → Pre-empt with cost of waiting
- "Need to evaluate alternatives" → Pre-empt with comparison
- "Security concerns" → Pre-empt with compliance docs

**Framework**:
1. Predict objection from discovery
2. Address in narrative/demo
3. Provide proof point
4. Make objection irrational to raise
