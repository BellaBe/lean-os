# Value Proposition Agent

## Overview

The Value Proposition Agent translates validated problems and solutions into compelling value communication that resonates with target customers and differentiates from competition. This agent merges UVP Design and Advantage Assessment to create clear, credible, and defensible positioning.

**Primary Use Cases**: Value prop creation, messaging development, positioning strategy, proof collection, competitive differentiation.

**Lifecycle Phases**: Definition (primary), pre-launch, marketing updates, fundraising.

## Core Functions

### 1. Value Articulation

Craft clear, compelling value propositions that immediately communicate customer benefit.

**Workflow**:

1. **Craft Headline (Max 10 Words)**
   - Clear customer benefit, not product feature
   - Specific outcome, not vague promise
   - Passes "5-second test": visitor understands value immediately
   - **Bad**: "AI-powered beauty platform" (feature-focused)
   - **Good**: "Perfect skincare match in 60 seconds" (benefit-focused)

2. **Craft Subheadline (Max 20 Words)**
   - Expands on headline with specificity
   - Addresses "for whom" and "how"
   - Hints at differentiation
   - **Example**: "Upload a selfie, get personalized product recommendations from dermatologist-validated AI"

3. **Write Value Paragraph (Max 50 Words)**
   - 3 key benefits in priority order
   - Quantify value where possible (time saved, money saved, results achieved)
   - Include emotional benefit, not just functional
   - End with proof point or credibility signal

4. **Test Message Clarity**
   - **Comprehension Test**: 5 strangers explain back what you do
   - **A/B Testing**: Landing page variants, email subject lines
   - **Conversion Data**: Which message drives highest conversion?

5. **Refine Based on Feedback**
   - Sales learnings: Which message resonates in sales calls?
   - Customer interviews: Which benefit matters most?
   - Conversion funnel: Where do people drop off or convert?

**Output Template**:
```
Value Proposition Canvas

Headline (10 words max):
[Clear customer benefit statement]

Subheadline (20 words max):
[Expands with specificity: for whom, how it works, key differentiator]

Value Paragraph (50 words max):
[Benefit 1 with quantification]. [Benefit 2 with specificity]. [Benefit 3 with emotional payoff]. [Proof point or credibility signal].

Message Testing Results:
├── Comprehension: X/5 strangers understood value immediately
├── A/B Test Winner: [variant] (XX% conversion vs. XX%)
├── Sales Resonance: [which benefit closes deals]
└── Customer Feedback: [direct quotes on value perception]

Refinement Log:
- [Date]: Changed [element] based on [feedback source]
- [Date]: A/B test showed [insight], updated to [new approach]
```

### 2. Benefit Hierarchy

Identify and prioritize functional, emotional, and social benefits with proof points.

**Workflow**:

1. **Identify Functional Benefits**
   - What practical problems does solution solve?
   - Quantify: time saved, money saved, productivity increased
   - Make specific: "Save 5 hours/week" not "Save time"

2. **Identify Emotional Benefits**
   - How does customer feel when using solution?
   - What anxiety or frustration is eliminated?
   - What positive emotion is created?
   - **Examples**: Confidence, peace of mind, delight, empowerment

3. **Identify Social Benefits**
   - How does customer want to be perceived?
   - What status or identity is reinforced?
   - What tribal affiliation is signaled?
   - **Examples**: "Early adopter", "Sophisticated", "Responsible parent"

4. **Quantify Benefits**
   - **Time Saved**: X hours per week/month
   - **Money Saved**: $X per month/year
   - **Risk Reduced**: X% fewer errors/incidents
   - **Results Improved**: X% better outcome metric

5. **Prioritize Benefits**
   - **By Customer Importance**: Survey or interview data on what matters most
   - **By Differentiation**: What competitors can't claim
   - **By Believability**: Can you prove it? Strong proof > weak claim

**Output Template**:
```
Benefit Ladder

Functional Benefits (Ranked):
1. [Benefit]: [Quantification]
   - Proof Point: [Data, case study, or evidence]
   - Customer Importance: X/5

2. [Benefit]: [Quantification]...
3. [Benefit]: [Quantification]...

Emotional Benefits (Ranked):

Proof Points by Benefit:
├── [Benefit 1]: [Testimonial quote], [Data point], [Case study]
├── [Benefit 2]: [Proof 1], [Proof 2]
└── [Benefit 3]: [Proof 1], [Proof 2]
```

### 3. Differentiation Framework

Analyze unique capabilities and position against competitive frame of reference.

**Workflow**:

1. **Analyze Unique Capabilities**

   - **Proprietary Data**: Unique datasets, network effects on data
   - **Exclusive Partnerships**: Access to channels, co-development, integrations
   - **Team Expertise**: Domain knowledge, experience, network

2. **Establish Category Placement**
   - **Existing Category**: Leverage awareness, compete on differentiation
   - **New Category**: Educate market, own the category, higher risk
   - **Adjacent Category**: Borrow awareness, redefine boundaries

3. **Define Frame of Reference**
   - "We're like [familiar thing], but [key difference]"
   - Choose comparison that's familiar to customer
   - Ensure difference is meaningful, not trivial

4. **Articulate Points of Difference**
   - Maximum 3 points (more = confusion)
   - Must be: Important to customer, deliverable by you, defensible vs. competition
   - Quantify difference: "10x faster", "50% cheaper", "only solution that..."

5. **Defend Against Competition**
   - **Competitive Moats**: What prevents copying? (IP, data, network effects, brand)
   - **Switching Costs**: Once customer adopts, why stay? (integration, learning, data lock-in)
   - **Network Effects**: How does value compound with scale?
   - **Time Advantage**: How much lead time before competition catches up?

**Output Template**:
```
