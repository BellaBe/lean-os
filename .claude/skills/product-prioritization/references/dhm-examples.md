## Hard-to-Copy Sources

| Source | Duration | Example |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Brand | Years | Apple's design reputation |
| Network Effects | Permanent | Marketplace with buyers+sellers |
| Technology | Years | Proprietary ML models |
| Scale | Permanent | Cost advantages from volume |
| Switching Costs | Years | Data lock-in, integrations |

## Common Mistakes

### Overscoring Delight
```
❌ "Users will love this!" (no evidence)
✓ "Top 3 requested feature, 50 support tickets/month"
```

### Underscoring Hard-to-Copy
```
❌ "Anyone can build this"
✓ "Requires 6 months of user data + domain expertise"
```

### Ignoring Margin
```
❌ "Revenue will follow"
✓ "Increases conversion 5% = $50K/month"
```

## Bonus Points

Give extra credit to H dimension — defensibility compounds over time.

```
Feature A: D=5, H=2, M=5 = 12
Feature B: D=4, H=5, M=3 = 12

Same score, but Feature B builds moat → prioritize B
