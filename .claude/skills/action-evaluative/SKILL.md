# Evaluative Action Skill

## Purpose
Judge an artifact or option against explicit or implied criteria.

## When to use
- “Is this good enough?”
- Reviews, audits, assessments
- Compare against standards or requirements

Do NOT use for:
- choosing an option (use decision-action)
- recommending changes (use prescriptive-actions)

## Operating rules
1. Use provided criteria; otherwise state assumed criteria.
2. Evaluate objectively with evidence.
3. Do not recommend solutions unless asked.

## Outputs
### Evaluation target
### Criteria
### Assessment table
- Criterion → Pass / Partial / Fail → Evidence

### Overall verdict
### Gaps / blockers
