# Announcement & LinkedIn Patterns

Short-form content patterns for product launches and company insights.

---

## Announcement Pattern

**Use when:** Launching product/feature, announcing milestone, major update

**Structure:** What → Why → How → Who → When

**Length:** 400-700 words

**Tone:** Informative, not promotional

### Structure Guide

**What (100-150 words):**
- Feature/product name
- One-sentence summary
- Primary benefit (specific, not vague)

**Why (150-200 words):**
- Problem this solves (from threads)
- Customer demand (data from sales/support)
- Strategic context (how it fits product vision)

**How (200-300 words):**
- Technical approach (architecture, methodology)
- Key capabilities (what it does)
- Differentiation (why not alternatives)

**Who (100-150 words):**
- Target customers (specific segments)
- Use cases (concrete examples)
- Requirements (technical, business)

**When & Pricing (50-100 words):**
- Availability (now, beta, Q1 2025)
- Pricing tier (if applicable)
- How to access (link to docs, not hard CTA)

### Example: {Premium Tier} Launch

```markdown
# {Feature/Product Name} Now Available for {Target Segment}

## What

{Product/feature description} is now available for {target customer segment}.
{Key capability description}—{differentiators}.

Primary benefit: {Core value proposition}.

## Why

After 5 deals in Q4, we learned 100% of {premium segment} chose
{premium tier} over {alternative tier}. The pattern was clear:

**Customer feedback:**
- "{Quote from customer about pain point}"
- "{Quote about why this matters to them}"
- "{Quote about business impact}"

**Business case:**
- {Target segment}: {Metric} vs {Benchmark}
- {Success criteria}: {Threshold or requirement}
- ROI matters: ${Savings} annual savings ({Customer} case study)

Strategic context: {How this fits your product strategy and positioning}.

## How

**Architecture:**
- {Technology stack}
- {Deployment model}
- {Key technical differentiators}
- {Performance specifications}

**Key capabilities:**
- {Capability 1} ({performance spec})
- {Capability 2}
- {Capability 3}
- {Compliance/security features}

**Why not alternatives:**

*{Alternative Option 1}:*
- Pro: {Benefit}
- Con: {Drawback}

*{Alternative Option 2}:*
- Pro: {Benefit}
- Con: {Drawback}

*{Your Solution}:*
- Pro: {Key benefits}
- Con: {Trade-off if any}

## Who

**Target customers:**
- {Customer segment} ({size/revenue criteria})
- {Business model} ({key characteristics})
- {Requirement 1}
- {Requirement 2}

**Use cases:**
- {Use case 1} ({specific problem solved})
- {Use case 2}
- {Use case 3}

**Requirements:**
- {Technology} frontend
- REST API integration capability
- {Infrastructure requirement}
- Analytics integration (optional)

## When & Pricing

**Availability:** Available now

**Pricing:**
- {Premium tier}: ${price}K+/year ({tier level})
- Includes: Custom branding, dedicated support, SLA, {compliance}

**How to access:**
- Technical docs: [link]
- Integration guide: [link]
- Contact for {tier level} tier: [email]

## Technical Details (Optional)

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Your {platform}
<script src="https://{subdomain}.yourbrand.com/{component}.js"></script>

// Configuration
{Component}.init({
  apiKey: 'your-key',
  theme: 'custom', // Inherits your {styling}
  subdomain: '{subdomain}.yourbrand.com'
});
```

**Performance:**
- Load time: <{load time}ms (async)
- API latency: <{latency}ms (p95)
- Uptime: {uptime}% SLA

**Integration time:** {timeframe} (typical)
```

## LinkedIn Pattern

**Use when:** Sharing business learning, industry insight, company milestone

**Structure:** Insight → Analysis → Implication

**Length:** 300-600 words

**Tone:** Thoughtful, data-driven, educational

### Pattern 1: Business Learning

**Structure:**
1. Opening observation (surprising data point)
2. Analysis (why this happened, what it means)
3. Implication (lesson learned, actionable insight)
4. Soft link (if relevant, no hard CTA)

**Example:**
```
We closed {N} deals in Q{quarter}. All {N} chose {option A}
over {option B}.

This wasn't about {misconception}. It was about {actual insight}.

**What we learned:**

{Target segment} prioritize {value 1} over {value 2}. They'll pay {premium}
for {option A} because:
- {Reason 1}
- {Reason 2}
- {Reason 3}

One customer ({segment}, ${metric}) told us: "{Quote about why this matters}"

**{Another segment} prefer {option B}.**

Opposite behavior:
- {Reason 1}
- {Reason 2}
- {Reason 3}

**Takeaway:**
Customer segment dictates product packaging. Same technology, different
positioning.

We're now offering both:
- {Option A}: {Tier name} (${price range})
- {Option B}: {Tier name} (${price range})

```

### Pattern 2: Industry Insight

**Structure:**
1. Industry observation (trend, pattern, data)
2. Analysis (breakdown, implications)
3. Non-obvious conclusion
4. Related content (if applicable)

**Example:**
```
{Industry} {metric}: {X}% average.
Everyone talks about reducing {problem}.
Few ask: what's causing them?

We analyzed {N} {data points} across {N} {entities}:
- {Root cause}: {X}%
- {Secondary cause}: {X}%
- {Tertiary cause}: {X}%
- {Minor cause}: {X}%

**The insight: {Problems} aren't {misconception}. They're {root cause}
failures.**

Breakdown of {root cause}:
- {Sub-cause 1}: {X}%
- {Sub-cause 2}: {X}%
- {Sub-cause 3}: {X}%

Here's the interesting part: {X}% of {users} who {problem} for {root cause}
{positive action} the same {item} in {different approach}. They want the {outcome}. {Baseline approach}
failed them.

**Implication:**
The ${X}B {problem category} isn't about {surface issue}. It's about {capability}
accuracy. {Baseline approach}: {X}% accurate. {Premium segment} need >{Y}%.

At {X}% {problem rate}, ${Y} AOV, a ${Z}M {entity} loses ${loss}M annually.
Fix {solution approach} → capture {X}% of that revenue.

```

### Pattern 3: Company Milestone

**Structure:**
1. Milestone announcement (specific achievement)
2. Context (what this means, why it matters)
3. Learning (what we discovered along the way)
4. Next step (where we're headed)

**Example:**
```
1 year ago we launched with 0 customers.
Today: ${revenue}M in {segment} contracts.

Not overnight success—{N} pivots, {N} failed deals, {N} product rebuilds.

**What changed:**

Initially: {Generic positioning} ({broad positioning})
Now: {Premium tier} for {premium segment} (specific segment)

The shift happened after deal #{N}. Customer said: "We need this, but
{alternative approach} breaks our {key requirement}."

That's when we realized: Problem wasn't {capability}. Problem was {key differentiator}
at high price points.

**Rebuilt the product:**
- {Premium tier} architecture (your brand, not ours)
- {Performance}% {capability} ({segment} threshold: >{X}%)
- {Timeframe} integration (vs {longer timeframe} custom build)

**Results:**
- 100% of {premium segment} chose {premium tier}
- 0% of {contrast segment} chose {premium tier}
- Same technology, different packaging

**Learning:**
Product-market fit isn't just what you build. It's how you package it
for specific segments.

Next: Expanding to {new vertical}. Same architecture, different
category. [Link to technical approach]

- Technical depth (architecture, performance)
- Data-driven (customer feedback, metrics)
- Differentiation (why not alternatives)
- Soft link (docs, not sales page)

**Bad announcement:**
- Buzzwords ("revolutionary", "game-changing")
- Vague benefits ("improve efficiency")
- No technical details
- Hard CTA throughout
- No target customer defined

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Announcement as Sales Pitch

**Wrong:**
```
Introducing our revolutionary AI-powered SDK! Transform your business
with cutting-edge technology! Book a demo now!
```

**Right:**
```
{Premium tier} {solution} now available. {Performance}% accuracy, {timeframe}
integration, zero co-branding. Technical docs: [link]
```

### ❌ LinkedIn Engagement Bait

**Wrong:**
```
Agree that AI is changing everything? 🚀 Comment your thoughts below!
#AI #Innovation #{IndustryTech}
```

**Right:**
```
5 deals. All chose {premium tier} over {alternative tier}. {Premium segment}
prioritize {key differentiator} over vendor recognition. Data: [thread]
```

### ❌ Vague Milestone

**Wrong:**
```
Excited to share we've grown significantly this year! Thanks to our 
amazing team! 🎉
```

**Right:**
```
$0 → ${revenue}M in 12 months. 5 pivots, 12 failed deals, 3 product rebuilds.
Key learning: Product-market fit = right packaging for specific segment.
```
