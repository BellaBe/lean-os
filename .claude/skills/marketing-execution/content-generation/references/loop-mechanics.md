# Loop Mechanics Reference

Content that doesn't generate loops is orphan content. Every piece must connect to the next.

## Loop Trigger Types

| Type | When to Use | Example CTA |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Implementation** | Tutorials, frameworks, methods | "Try this and share your result" |
| **Question** | Insights, observations, opinions | "What's your version of this?" |
| **Challenge** | Templates, rewrites, transformations | "Rewrite yours. Tag me." |
| **Offer** | Problem posts, pain points | "Facing this? DM me" |

## Trigger Placement

Loop trigger goes at the **end** of content. Reader consumes value first, then acts.

**Structure:**
```
[Value delivery — 80% of content]

---

[Loop trigger — clear, single action]
```

## Velocity Framing

Every piece needs a before → after with time compression.

**Pattern:**
```
{Long time} to {old way}.
{Short time} to {new way}.
```

**Examples:**
- "Three weeks to build. Twenty minutes to realize it was wrong."
- "Days of writing. Minutes of review."
- "Months of hiring. Hours to find the wrong fit."

**Placement:** First half of content. Hook with transformation.

## Loop Examples

### Implementation Loop (Tutorial)

```markdown
# How I Cut Meeting Time 60%

[Content: The method, step-by-step]

---

Try this for one week. Share your before/after in the comments.
```

**Why it loops:** Reader implements → shares result → others see → try themselves

### Question Loop (Insight)

```markdown
# The Biggest Lie in Startup Advice

[Content: The insight, evidence, implications]

---

What advice did you have to unlearn?
```

**Why it loops:** Reader reflects → comments → engagement drives reach → new readers

### Challenge Loop (Template)

```markdown
# The One-Line Positioning Statement

[Content: Framework, examples]

---

Write yours in the comments. I'll give feedback on the first 10.
```

**Why it loops:** Reader participates → gets value → shares their version → others see

### Offer Loop (Problem Post)

```markdown
# Why Your AI Project Will Fail

[Content: Common failure patterns]

---

Dealing with this right now? DM me — happy to look at your architecture.
```

**Why it loops:** Reader with problem → DMs → conversation → potential client or case study

## Anti-Patterns

### ❌ No Trigger (Orphan Content)

```markdown
# 5 Tips for Better Code Reviews

[Content...]

Thanks for reading!
```

**Problem:** No next action. Content dies.

### ❌ Weak Trigger (Generic CTA)

```markdown
[Content...]

What do you think? Let me know in the comments!
```

**Problem:** Too vague. No specific action.

### ❌ Multiple Triggers (Confused Reader)

```markdown
[Content...]

Try this method! Also, what's your experience? And DM me if you need help!
```

**Problem:** Decision paralysis. Pick one.

### ❌ Trigger Before Value (Premature Ask)

```markdown
Before I share this framework, I'd love to know — what's your biggest challenge?

[Content...]
```

**Problem:** Asking before giving. Feels extractive.

## Loop Metrics

What to track to know if loops are working:

| Metric | Indicates |
|--------|-----------|
| Comments with implementations | Implementation trigger working |
| Quote tweets/reshares | Content worth spreading |
| DMs received | Offer trigger working |
| User-generated content | Loop completing |

**Ignore:** Likes, impressions, follower count

## Validation Checklist

Before publishing:

- [ ] Loop trigger present at end
- [ ] Trigger is specific (not generic)
- [ ] Single trigger (not multiple asks)
- [ ] Velocity framing in first half
- [ ] Value delivered before asking
