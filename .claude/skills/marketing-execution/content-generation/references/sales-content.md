# Sales Content Reference

Guidelines for content that enables sales conversations.

## Case Study Structure

```markdown
# {Customer Name}: {Result Headline}

## Challenge
{What problem they faced — buyer can relate}

## Solution
{How your product solved it — specific, not generic}

## Results
{Quantified outcomes — metrics, timeframes}

## Quote
"{Customer testimonial}"
— {Name}, {Title}, {Company}
```

### Case Study Rules

- Lead with result, not company name
- Include specific metrics (%, $, time)
- Quote from decision-maker level
- End with "Talk to us" CTA

### Example

```markdown
# Acme Corp: 40% Reduction in Returns

## Challenge

costing $2M annually in reverse logistics.

integrated with their Shopify Plus store in 2 weeks.

## Results
- 40% reduction in returns (25% → 15%)
- $800K annual savings
- 12% increase in AOV
- ROI positive in 6 weeks

## Quote
"We paid for the entire year in the first month of savings."
— Sarah Chen, VP E-commerce, Acme Corp

## Battle Card Structure

```markdown
# vs {Competitor}

## When They Come Up
{Trigger phrases from prospect}

## Their Positioning
{How they describe themselves}

## Our Differentiation

| Area | Them | Us |
|------|------|-----|
| {area} | {weakness} | {strength} |
| {area} | {weakness} | {strength} |

## Objection Handling

**"They're cheaper"**
→ {Response with ROI framing}

**"They have feature X"**
→ {Response with alternative or roadmap}

**"We already use them"**
→ {Response with switching benefit}

## Landmines to Plant
{Questions to ask that expose their weakness}

## Proof Points
{Case studies, metrics that counter them}
```

### Battle Card Rules

- Keep updated (competitors change)
- Focus on 2-3 key differentiators
- Include specific proof points
- Never trash-talk (professional)

## Email Sequence Principles

### Structure

```
Email 1 (Day 0): Value-first introduction
Email 2 (Day 3): Social proof / case study
Email 3 (Day 7): Address common objection
Email 4 (Day 10): Direct ask
Email 5 (Day 14): Breakup email
```

### Rules

1. **Value first** — Give before asking
2. **One CTA per email** — Don't confuse
3. **Personalization** — Reference their context
4. **Timing** — Vary by persona/deal size
5. **Exit gracefully** — Final email acknowledges silence

### Email Templates

**Value-first introduction:**
```
Subject: {Specific insight about their business}

Hi {Name},

Noticed {specific observation about their company}.

{Insight or resource that helps — no pitch}

{Soft CTA or question}

{Signature}
```

**Breakup email:**
```
Subject: Closing the loop

Hi {Name},

Haven't heard back, so I'll assume the timing isn't right.

If {problem you solve} becomes a priority, happy to chat.

Removing you from my follow-up sequence.

{Signature}
```

## ROI Calculator Elements

| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| Current metric (e.g., return rate) | Projected improvement |
| Volume (orders, users) | Dollar savings |
| Cost of problem | ROI timeline |
| Implementation cost | Payback period |

### ROI Framing

```
Current state: {metric}
With {product}: {improved metric}
Annual impact: ${savings}
Investment: ${cost}
ROI: {X}x in {timeframe}
```

Always let prospect input their own numbers — more believable.
