# Content Pattern Principles

Patterns are structure guides, not rigid templates.

## What Patterns Are

**Patterns provide:**
- Core structure (problem → solution → result)
- Opening approaches (5-7 examples per pattern)
- Transition techniques (how to move between sections)
- Length ranges (guidance, not requirements)
- Common pitfalls (what to avoid)

**Patterns do NOT provide:**
- Exact word counts (flexibility for content)
- Fill-in-the-blank templates (requires thinking)
- Prescribed phrasing (use natural language)
- Step-by-step scripts (adapt to context)

## How to Use Patterns

### 1. Select Pattern Based on Purpose

**Problem Analysis Pattern:**
- Use when: Explaining industry problem, sharing research, analyzing trends
- Structure: Problem → Data → Analysis → Implication
- Example: "Why {X}% of {Industry} {Problems} Are {Root Cause}"

**Implementation Guide Pattern:**
- Use when: Teaching how to solve problem, technical tutorial
- Structure: Challenge → Approach → Implementation → Results
- Example: "Building Real-Time {Recommendations} with {Technology}"

**Case Study Pattern:**
- Use when: Sharing customer success, validating approach
- Structure: Customer → Problem → Solution → Results
- Example: "How {Customer} Reduced {Key Metric} 38% with {Solution Approach}"

**Announcement Pattern:**
- Use when: Launching product/feature, major milestone
- Structure: What → Why → How → Who → When
- Example: "{Solution Approach} Now Available for {Target Segment}"

**LinkedIn Insight Pattern:**
- Use when: Sharing business learning, industry observation
- Structure: Insight → Analysis → Implication
- Example: "{X}% of {Premium Segment} Chose {Option A} Over {Option B}"

### 2. Adapt Structure to Content

**Pattern gives skeleton, not script:**

Pattern says:
```
Introduction (100-150 words)
- Problem context
- Why it matters
- What reader will learn
```

You write:
```
When we launched our {product}, we assumed {segment} companies would prefer
{alternative approach}. After {N} deals, we learned we were wrong.

{X}% of {premium segment} (${revenue}+ {metric}) chose {solution approach}. This wasn't
about {misconception}—it was about {key differentiator} being
non-negotiable in {industry}.

Here's what ${revenue} in contracts taught us about {positioning topic}.
```

**Use pattern as guide, not script.**

### 3. Apply Brand Voice

**Pattern provides structure. Voice provides tone.**

Every pattern follows brand voice:
- **Educational:** Teach, don't sell
- **Data-driven:** Specific metrics, not vague claims
- **Technical:** Include architecture, methodology
- **Honest:** Admit uncertainties, limitations
- **No sales language:** No buzzwords, CTAs, engagement tricks

**Example:**

❌ Template-following (wrong):
```
Our revolutionary AI-powered solution leverages cutting-edge
machine learning to dramatically improve customer satisfaction.
Book a demo to see the magic!
```

✅ Pattern + Voice (right):
```
We trained our {model} on {N}+ {data points}. Accuracy went from
{X}% ({baseline approach}) to {Y}% ({improved approach}).

The challenge: {premium segment} customers expect >{Z}% accuracy. At {Y}%,
we cross the credibility threshold. Below {Z}%, {key metric} stays high.
```

### 4. Include Technical Depth

**Patterns guide structure. Depth builds credibility.**

Each pattern requires technical details:
- Architecture approaches
- Methodology explanations
- Performance specifications
- Implementation challenges

**Example from case study:**

Pattern says: "Technical Details (200-300 words)"

You write:
```
## Technical Details

**Architecture:**
- {Component} loaded asynchronously (no page speed impact)
- {API type}: <{X}ms latency
- {System component}: {uptime}% uptime
- {Dashboard}: Real-time {data type}

**Challenges overcome:**
1. {Challenge 1}: {Solution approach} matching {Customer} {requirements}
2. {Challenge 2}: {Optimization technique} prevented slowdown
3. {Challenge 3}: {Compliance}-compliant {data handling}

**Why it worked:**
- {Solution approach} removed {friction point}
- {X}% accuracy exceeded {segment} threshold
- Fast integration minimized {resource} burden
```

### 5. Use Source Material

**Patterns provide structure. Threads provide content.**

All content comes from:
- Thread learning (facts, metrics, insights)
- Canvas positioning (value proposition, problem)
- Sales narratives (customer language, pain points)
- Brand voice guidelines (tone, style)

**Never invent:**
- Customer names (check thread for approval)
- Metrics (use exact numbers from threads)
- Technical details (match thread specifications)
- Customer quotes (use verbatim or don't include)

## Pattern Selection Matrix

| Content Goal | Pattern | Length | Depth |
|--------------|---------|--------|-------|
| Explain problem | Problem Analysis | 800-1,200 | Medium |
| Teach solution | Implementation Guide | 1,200-2,000 | High |
| Share success | Case Study | 1,000-1,500 | High |
| Launch product | Announcement | 400-700 | Low |
| Quick insight | LinkedIn Post | 300-600 | Medium |
| Curated update | Newsletter | 400-600 | Low |

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Following Pattern Too Rigidly

**Wrong:**
```
Introduction (exactly 150 words)
The problem with {industry} {problems} is... [fills exactly 150 words
even if unnatural]
```

**Right:**
```
When we launched, we assumed {segment} wanted {alternative approach}.
We were wrong. [Natural length, ~30 words]
```

### ❌ Skipping Technical Depth

**Wrong:**
```
We used AI to improve {recommendations}. It worked well.
```

**Right:**
```
We trained our model on {N}+ {data points}. Accuracy: {Y}% vs {X}%
baseline. Challenge: {premium segment} customers expect >{Z}% accuracy to trust.
```

### ❌ Adding Sales Language

**Wrong:**
```
Our revolutionary solution delivers unprecedented results! 
Book a demo today!
```

**Right:**
```
{Solution approach} available for {target segment} (${price}+ tier).
Technical docs: [link]
```

### ❌ Inventing Data

**Wrong:**
```
Many customers saw significant improvements in conversion rates.
```

**Right:**
```
{Customer}: {Key metric} {before} → {after} ({X}% reduction). {Secondary metric} +{Y}%.

## Quality Checklist

Before completing draft:

- [ ] **Structure:** Follows pattern guide (not template)
- [ ] **Voice:** Educational, technical, data-driven (no sales language)
- [ ] **Depth:** Includes architecture, methodology, challenges
- [ ] **Accuracy:** All metrics from threads (no invented data)
- [ ] **Source:** All claims traceable to threads/Canvas
- [ ] **Length:** Within range for pattern (flexible)
- [ ] **Approval:** Customer names checked for public use

## Remember

**Patterns are guides, not scripts.**

Good content = Pattern structure + Brand voice + Technical depth + Thread facts

Success = Educational content that builds authority organically.
