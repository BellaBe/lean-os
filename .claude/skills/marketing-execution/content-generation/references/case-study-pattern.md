# Case Study Pattern

Customer success stories as educational content.

**Use when:** Sharing customer results, validating approach with real data, demonstrating ROI

**Structure:** Customer → Problem → Solution → Results → Technical Details

**Length:** 1,000-1,500 words

---

## Core Principle

Case studies are **evidence**, not sales pitches. Show what happened, include numbers, explain why it worked.

**Good case study:**
- Specific metrics ({before}% → {after}% on key metric)
- Technical details (architecture, implementation)
- Honest about challenges (what didn't work)
- Educational (lessons others can apply)

**Bad case study:**
- Vague claims ("dramatically improved")
- No technical depth (just results)
- Overly promotional (selling, not teaching)
- Cherry-picked success (hiding failures)

## Opening Approaches

### Result-First Opening

Start with the outcome, then explain how:

```
# {Customer} Achieved {X}% Improvement with {Solution Approach}

{Customer} is a {industry} company with {scale metric}. They faced {problem}
costing {$X} annually.

After implementing {solution approach}, {key metric} improved by {X}%—
{result description}. Here's how they did it, what challenges they
faced, and what we learned.
```

### Problem-First Opening

Start with customer pain, then reveal solution:

```
# How {Customer} Fixed {Problem} in {Timeframe}

{Customer} had a problem: {problem description}. At {scale metric},
that's {$X} in lost revenue annually—plus {$Y} in operational costs.

{Previous solutions} weren't working. {Alternative approach} improved
from {X}% to {Y}%—not enough for {customer segment} who expect {standard}.

Here's how they got to {target metric} and achieved {result}.
```

### Challenge-First Opening

Start with what makes this difficult:

```
# The Challenge: {Tradeoff A} vs {Tradeoff B}

{Customer} needed {target metric} to achieve {goal}. But every
solution they evaluated required {compromise}—breaking their
{important constraint}.

The dilemma: Accept {suboptimal option A}, or compromise {priority}
for {benefit}?

Here's how they solved both with {solution approach}.
```

## Structure Guide

### Customer Overview (100-150 words)

**What to include:**
- Company name, industry, size (GMV, customers)
- Business model (B2C marketplace, D2C brand)
- Initial challenge (quantified)

**Example:**
```
{Customer} is a {industry} company with {scale metric} serving {customer count}
monthly customers. Their {business focus} emphasizes {key differentiator}—
where {critical factor} is essential.

They faced {problem} costing {$X} annually in {cost categories}.
```

**Don't:**
- Generic company description
- Vague metrics ("large customer base")
- Skip the initial problem

---

### The Problem (250-350 words)

**What to include:**
- Specific pain point (quantified impact)
- Business cost (revenue, operations, customer experience)
- Previous solutions attempted (what failed and why)
- Why change was needed now

**Example:**
```
## The Problem

{Customer segment} expect {quality standard}. {Customer}'s previous
solution had these issues:

- {Issue 1}
- {Issue 2}
- {Issue 3}
- {Issue 4}

Beyond {surface problem}, {core metric} was insufficient:
- {Alternative 1}: {X}% accuracy
- {Alternative 2}: {Y}% accuracy
- Neither met the {target}% threshold {Customer} needed

At {problem rate}, {average value}, and {volume}:
- Revenue impact: {$X}
- Operational costs: {$Y}
- Support costs: {$Z}
- Total annual cost: {$Total}

**What they tried:**

1. **{Approach 1}** → {Result/limitation}
2. **{Approach 2}** → {Result/limitation}
3. **{Approach 3}** → {Result/limitation}

None solved both {requirement A} AND {requirement B}.
```

**Don't:**
- Skip the cost quantification
- Ignore previous attempts
- Use generic pain points ("needed better solution")

---

### Solution (300-400 words)

**What to include:**
- What they implemented (specific technology/approach)
- Technical approach (architecture, integration)
- Implementation timeline and resources
- Why this approach worked

**Example:**
```
## Solution

{Customer} implemented {solution} with {customization}:

**Technical approach:**
- {Technology stack}
- {Customization details}
- {Deployment approach}
- {Key technical feature}

**Integration:**
- {Timeline}
- {Resource requirement}
- {Infrastructure changes}
- {Integration method}

**Core capability:**
- {Technical foundation}
- {Accuracy/performance metric}
- {Personalization/customization}

**Why {approach} mattered:**

{Customer} customers {customer profile}. At this {context}:
- {Requirement 1}
- {Requirement 2}
- {Requirement 3}

{Solution approach} removed {friction} while delivering {result}—
crossing the {segment} credibility threshold.

**Architecture:**
```
{Component 1} → {Component 2} → {Component 3}
                                      ↓
                              {Processing layer}
                                      ↓
                              {Result/output}
```

**Implementation details:**
- {Performance characteristic 1}
- {Performance characteristic 2}
- {Reliability metric}
- {Additional capability}
```

**Don't:**
- Skip technical details (how it actually works)
- Use buzzwords instead of architecture
- Omit implementation timeline/resources

---

### Results (300-400 words)

**What to include:**
- Metrics (before/after with timeline)
- Business impact (revenue, costs, efficiency)
- Unexpected benefits
- Customer quote (if available)

**Example:**
```
## Results

**{Timeframe} pilot ({scope}):**
- {Primary metric}: {before} → {after} ({X}% improvement)
- {Secondary metric}: {value} (vs {baseline} baseline)
- {Tertiary metric}: {before} → {after} ({X}% improvement)
- {Additional metric}: +{X}% ({explanation})

**Annual projection:**
- {Benefit 1}: {quantity} ({calculation})
- {Benefit 2}: {$X}
- {Benefit 3}: {$Y}
- {Benefit 4}: {$Z}
- Total annual {benefit}: {$Total}

**ROI:**
- Implementation cost: {$X}/year
- {Benefit type}: {$Y}/year
- Net benefit: {$Z} ({X}% ROI)
- Payback: {X} months

**Unexpected benefits:**

1. **{Benefit 1}**
   - {Reason 1}
   - {Reason 2}
   - {Reason 3}

2. **{Benefit 2}**
   - {Reason 1}
   - {Reason 2}
   - {Reason 3}

3. **{Benefit 3}**
   - {Reason 1}
   - {Reason 2}
   - {Reason 3}

**Customer quote:**

"{Quote that captures key value proposition and result}"
— {Name}, {Title}, {Customer}
```

**Don't:**
- Use vague metrics ("significant improvement")
- Skip the ROI calculation
- Omit unexpected learnings

---

### Technical Details (200-300 words)

**What to include:**
- Architecture/integration approach
- Challenges overcome
- Why it worked (technical reasoning)
- Applicability to others

**Example:**
```
## Technical Details

**Architecture:**
- {Component}: {characteristic}
- {Component}: {performance metric}
- {Component}: {reliability metric}
- {Component}: {capability}

**Challenges overcome:**

1. **{Challenge 1}:** {Brief description}
   - Solution: {Technical approach}

- {Factor 3}

**Applicability:**

This approach works for {industry} companies with:
- {Characteristic 1}
- {Characteristic 2}
- {Characteristic 3}
- {Characteristic 4}
```

**Don't:**
- Skip the challenges (makes success seem easy)
- Use generic architecture descriptions
- Omit applicability criteria

---

### Conclusion (100-150 words)

**What to include:**
- Key success factors (3-5 points)
- Lessons learned
- Applicability to readers
- Soft link to product (if relevant)

**Example:**
```
## Conclusion

{Customer}'s success validates three insights:

1. **{Insight 1}** - {Explanation}

2. **{Insight 2}** - {Explanation}

3. **{Insight 3}** - {Explanation}

This approach works for {industry} companies with {key characteristics}.

## Remember

Case studies are **evidence-based education**, not sales collateral.

Good case study = Specific metrics + Technical depth + Honest challenges + Applicable lessons

Success = Reader learns what works, why it works, and when to apply it
