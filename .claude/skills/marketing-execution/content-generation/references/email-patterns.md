# Email Pattern

Newsletter and announcement emails that educate, don't sell.

**Use when:** Weekly/monthly newsletter, product announcement email, educational series

**Length:** 400-600 words

**Tone:** Personal, educational, non-promotional

---

## Core Principles

**Good email:**
- Curates knowledge (links to full content)
- Personal voice (from real person)
- Educational focus (teaching, not selling)
- Scannable structure (sections, headers)
- No hard CTAs (soft links at most)

**Bad email:**
- Sales pitch in disguise
- Generic corporate voice
- Walls of text (not scannable)
- Multiple CTAs ("Book now!", "Try free!")
- Engagement tricks ("Click here to learn more!")

---

## Newsletter Pattern

**Use when:** Regular updates (weekly, monthly), curated insights, company news

**Structure:** Personal greeting → 2-3 sections (insight/resource/update) → Closing

### Structure Guide

**Subject Line:**
- Specific value, not clickbait
- 40-60 characters
- Preview extends subject (doesn't repeat)

**Examples:**
```
✅ "Why {premium segment} choose {premium tier}" (specific)
✅ "Q4 learning: 5 deals, 1 pattern" (concrete)
✅ "How {Customer} reduced {key metric} 38%" (data-driven)

❌ "You won't believe this!" (clickbait)
❌ "Our latest insights" (vague)
❌ "Amazing customer success story" (promotional)
```

**Opening (50-75 words):**
- Personal greeting (not generic)
- Context: Why this matters now
- Preview: What they'll learn

**Section 1: Key Insight (150-200 words):**
- Business learning or announcement
- Supporting data/context
- Link to full article (if applicable)

**Section 2: Educational Resource (150-200 words):**
- How-to content, case study, technical guide
- Practical takeaway
- Link to full content

**Section 3: Update (100-150 words):**
- Product update, milestone, industry news

- No hard CTA

### Newsletter Example

```
Subject: Why {premium segment} choose {premium tier} over {alternative tier}
Preview: 5 deals in Q4. All picked {premium tier}. Here's what we learned.

---

Hey [Name],

We closed 5 {segment} deals in Q4. All 5 chose {premium tier}
over our {alternative tier} option.

Not what we expected. Here's what we learned about {segment}
positioning—and a case study showing how one customer reduced {key metric} 38%.

---

**Q4 Learning: {Premium Segment} Won't Compromise on {Key Differentiator}**

100% of {premium segment} (${threshold}M+ {metric}) chose {premium tier} over {alternative tier}
—even though {premium tier} costs 3x more.

Why? {Key differentiator} at ${price point}+ price points is non-negotiable:
- {Alternative tier} breaks {experience quality}
- Third-party branding reduces customer trust
- {Platform} experience needs seamless integration

One customer ({segment}, ${revenue}M {metric}) told us: "Our customers
don't care who powers {solution}. They care it looks like us."

Meanwhile, {contrast segment} (${lower threshold}M-${mid threshold}M {metric}) prefer {alternative tier} for
credibility ("powered by {technology}") and lower cost.

Same technology. Different packaging. Segment matters more than product.

**Case Study: How {Customer} Reduced {Key Metric} 38% in 30 Days**

{Customer} ({segment}, ${revenue}M {metric}) faced {X}% {problem} on
{category}—${cost}M annual cost.

After implementing {premium tier} {solution}:
- {Key metric}: {before}% → {after}% ({improvement}% reduction)
- {Secondary metric}: {performance}% (vs {baseline}% {alternative approach})
- ROI: ${savings}K net benefit ({roi}% ROI, {payback}-month payback)

Technical details: {Technology stack}, <{latency}ms API latency, custom {styling} matching
their {requirements} exactly. No third-party branding.

Implementation time: {timeframe} ({hours} hours {resource}).

The case study includes architecture diagrams, ROI breakdown, and
lessons on what didn't work.

**Product Update: {Premium Tier} Now Generally Available**

Based on Q4 demand, {premium tier} is now available for all {segment}
({criteria}).

What's included:
- {Performance metric}% {capability} (trained on {N}M+ {data})
- Full custom branding (your {customization options})
- {Timeframe} integration (typical timeline)
- {Service level} SLA ({uptime}% uptime, dedicated support)

Pricing: ${price}K+/year ({tier} tier)

same architecture, different category.

## Announcement Email Pattern

**Use when:** Product launch, major feature, company milestone

**Structure:** What happened → Why it matters → What you can do

### Structure Guide

**Subject Line:**
- Clear announcement, not teaser
- 40-60 characters

**Examples:**
```
✅ "{Premium tier} now available for {segment}"
✅ "Introducing: Real-time {solution}"

❌ "Big news from {Your Product}!"
❌ "You've been waiting for this"
```

**Opening (50-75 words):**
- Announcement (what's new)
- Why this matters (problem solved)

**Body (300-400 words):**
- What this enables (capabilities)
- Who it's for (target customers)
- How it works (technical overview)
- When available (timeline)

**Closing (25-50 words):**
- Next step (soft link to docs)
- Personal sign-off

### Announcement Example

```
Subject: {Premium tier} {solution} now available
Preview: Deploy {solution description} under your brand.

---

Hey [Name],

{Premium tier} is now available for {segment}.

After 5 deals chose {premium tier} over {alternative tier} in Q4, we
made it generally available. Deploy {performance}% {capability} without third-party
branding or {alternative approach}.

Here's what you need to know.

---

**What This Enables**

Full brand control:
- Your domain ({subdomain}.yourbrand.com)
- Your styling (custom {styling options})
- Zero external attribution or logos
- Seamless {platform} experience

Same {performance}% {capability} as {alternative tier} version:
- Trained on {N}M+ {data points}
- Personalized {output} per {user}
- <{latency}ms API latency
- Real-time analytics dashboard

**Who It's For**

{Segment} with:
- Strong brand identity ({characteristics})
- High {metric} (>${threshold})
- Technical capacity ({hours} hours integration)
- Volume to justify cost (${price}K+/year)

**How It Works**

1. Deploy {technology} on your {platform}
2. Host {component} on your subdomain
3. Customize styling to match your {requirements}
4. Integrate via REST API

Implementation time: {timeframe} (typical)

Technical architecture:
```
Your {platform} → {subdomain}.yourbrand.com ({premium tier} {component})
               ↓
         {API layer}
               ↓
         {Processing Engine}
               ↓
         {Output}
```

**When Available**

Now. Technical docs and integration guide ready.

## Educational Series Pattern

**Use when:** Multi-part email course, onboarding sequence, how-to series

**Structure:** Lesson intro → Key concept → Example → Practice/next step

### Structure Guide

**Part indicator:**
- Clear position in series (Part 2 of 5)
- Previous/next context

**Lesson structure:**
- Concept introduction (what you'll learn)
- Explanation (how it works)
- Example (real application)
- Practice (what to try)
- Next lesson preview

### Example: {Solution} Series (Part 2/5)

```
Subject: Part 2: Why {baseline approach} fails ({Solution} Series)
Preview: {Baseline approach}: {X}% accurate. Here's why—and what works.

---

Hey [Name],

Part 2 of our {solution} series. Last time: Why {X}% of {problems} are
{root cause}. Today: Why {baseline approach} doesn't work.

Quick recap: {Industry} {problems} cost ${X}B annually. {Y}% are {root cause},
not {misconception}. Problem: {Baseline approach} are only {X}% accurate.

Let's explore why—and what accuracy threshold {premium segment} need.

---

**Why {Baseline Approach} Fails**

{Baseline approach} are based on {generalization}. Problem: {Reality differs}.

**Example: {Generic scenario}**

{Baseline approach}:
- {Criterion 1}: {range}
- {Criterion 2}: {range}
- {Criterion 3}: {range}

Assumes {assumption}. Reality: {Reality}.

{User} A (fits {criterion 1}): {specific measurements}
{User} B (fits {criterion 2}): {different measurements}

Both are {category} by one measurement. Wrong {output} by others.

**Accuracy breakdown:**

We analyzed {N} {data points}:
- {Baseline approach}: {X}% accurate
- {Alternative 1}: {Y}% accurate
- {Solution approach}: {Z}% accurate

{Premium segment} threshold: >{threshold}% accuracy to build trust.

**What Works: {Solution Approach}**

Instead of "{Generic question}", ask: "{Personalized question}"

Approach:
1. {Step 1}
2. {Step 2}
3. {Step 3}

Result: {Performance}% accuracy (trained on {N}M+ {data points})

**Try This:**

Next time you {use case}, note: Does {provider} use {baseline approach} or
{solution approach}?

{Baseline}: "{Generic output}"
{Solution}: "{Personalized output}"

Difference: {Baseline} assumes {assumption}. {Solution}
{actual capability}.

---

**Next: Part 3 - How {Solution Approach} Achieves {Performance}% Accuracy**

We'll cover:
- {Technical detail 1}
- {Technical detail 2}
- Why {alternative} tops out at {X}%

Coming Wednesday.
