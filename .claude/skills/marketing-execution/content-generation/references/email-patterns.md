### Newsletter Example

```
Subject: Why luxury brands choose white-label SDK over co-branded
Preview: 5 deals in Q4. All picked white-label. Here's what we learned.

---

Hey [Name],

We closed 5 enterprise fashion deals in Q4. All 5 chose white-label 
SDK over our co-branded option.

Not what we expected. Here's what we learned about luxury brand 
positioning—and a case study showing how one customer reduced returns 38%.

---

**Q4 Learning: Luxury Brands Won't Compromise on Brand Consistency**

100% of luxury brands ($100M+ GMV) chose white-label over co-branded 
widgets—even though white-label costs 3x more.

Why? Brand consistency at $200+ price points is non-negotiable:
- Co-branded widgets break visual aesthetic
- Third-party branding reduces customer trust
- Mobile experience needs seamless integration

One customer (luxury marketplace, $200M GMV) told us: "Our customers 
don't care who powers fit tech. They care it looks like us."

Meanwhile, fast fashion brands ($10M-$50M GMV) prefer co-branded for 
credibility ("powered by AI") and lower cost.

Same technology. Different packaging. Segment matters more than product.

**Case Study: How ElsaAI Reduced Returns 38% in 30 Days**

ElsaAI (luxury marketplace, $200M GMV) faced 25% return rates on 
dresses—$2.1M annual cost.

After implementing white-label fit recommendations:
- Return rate: 25% → 18% (28% reduction)
- Fit accuracy: 94% (vs 68% generic size charts)
- ROI: $305K net benefit (61% ROI, 7.4-month payback)

Technical details: React SDK, <200ms API latency, custom CSS matching 
their design system exactly. No third-party branding.

Implementation time: 2 weeks (10 hours engineering).

The case study includes architecture diagrams, ROI breakdown, and 
lessons on what didn't work.

**Product Update: White-Label SDK Now Generally Available**

Based on Q4 demand, white-label SDK is now available for all enterprise 
fashion brands ($100M+ GMV).

- Full custom branding (your fonts, colors, domain)

- Enterprise SLA (99.9% uptime, dedicated support)

Pricing: $400K+/year (enterprise tier)

Hey [Name],

White-label SDK is now available for enterprise fashion brands.

After 5 enterprise deals chose white-label over co-branded in Q4, we 
made it generally available. Deploy 94% fit accuracy without third-party 
branding or co-branded widgets.

Here's what you need to know.

---

**What This Enables**

Full brand control:

Same 94% fit accuracy as co-branded version:
- Trained on 10M+ body scans

**Who It's For**

Enterprise fashion brands with:
- Strong brand identity (luxury, premium)

**How It Works**

1. Deploy React SDK on your site
2. Host widget on your subdomain

4. Integrate via REST API

Implementation time: 2 weeks (typical)

Technical architecture:
```

## Educational Series Pattern

### Example: Fit Prediction Series (Part 2/5)

```
Subject: Part 2: Why size charts fail (Fit Prediction Series)
Preview: Generic size charts: 68% accurate. Here's why—and what works.

---

Hey [Name],

Part 2 of our fit prediction series. Last time: Why 73% of returns are 
fit issues. Today: Why size charts don't work.

Quick recap: Fashion returns cost $743B annually. 73% are fit issues, 
not buyer's remorse. Problem: Generic size charts are only 68% accurate.

Let's explore why—and what accuracy threshold luxury brands need.

---

**Why Generic Size Charts Fail**

Size charts are based on population averages. Problem: Nobody is average.

**Example: "Medium" dress**

Generic size chart:
- Bust: 36-38"
- Waist: 28-30"
- Hips: 38-40"

Assumes proportions scale together. Reality: They don't.

Customer A (fits "Medium" bust): 37" bust, 26" waist, 41" hips
Customer B (fits "Medium" waist): 39" bust, 29" waist, 37" hips

Both are "Medium" by one measurement. Wrong size by others.

**Accuracy breakdown:**

We analyzed 10,000 purchases:
- Generic size charts: 68% accurate
- Virtual try-on (single-angle): 72% accurate
- Body scanning (multi-point): 94% accurate

Luxury threshold: >90% accuracy to build trust.

**What Works: Personalized Fit Prediction**

Instead of "What size is Medium?", ask: "What size fits this body?"

Approach:
1. Measure customer body (height, weight, shape)
2. Compare to garment fit data (measurements per size)
3. Predict best size (personalized, not generic)

Result: 94% accuracy (trained on 10M+ body scans)

**Try This:**

Next time you shop online, note: Does site use generic size chart or 
personalized recommendations?

Generic: "Size M fits bust 36-38""
Personalized: "Based on your measurements, size M will fit"

Difference: Generic assumes you know your measurements. Personalized 
computes fit for you.

---

**Next: Part 3 - How Body Scanning Achieves 94% Accuracy**

We'll cover:
- Multi-point measurement approach
- ML training on 10M+ body scans
- Why single-angle virtual try-on tops out at 72%

Coming Wednesday.
