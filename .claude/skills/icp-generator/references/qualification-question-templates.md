# Qualification Question Templates

## Purpose

Convert ICP criteria into qualification questions that enable quick, objective go/no-go decisions.

**Key principle**: Every qualification question should map directly to an ICP criterion.

## Question Types

### 1. Discovery Questions (Open-ended)
**Purpose**: Understand current state, uncover problems, build rapport
**When**: Early in conversation (first 5 minutes)
**Format**: Open-ended, encourages storytelling

### 2. Qualification Questions (Yes/No or Numeric)
**Purpose**: Determine fit against ICP criteria
**When**: After initial discovery (minutes 5-10)
**Format**: Closed-ended, objective, quick to answer

### 3. Disqualification Questions (Hard Filters)
**Purpose**: Identify immediate dealbreakers
**When**: As early as possible (save everyone's time)
**Format**: Yes/no, clear pass/fail

## Discovery Question Templates

### Current State Questions

**Template**: "Walk me through how you currently [do process/handle situation]"

**Examples**:
- "Walk me through how you currently handle product returns."
- "Walk me through your current customer onboarding process."
- "Walk me through how your team manages data pipelines today."

**Why it works**: Open-ended, non-judgmental, surfaces real workflows and pain points

---

**Template**: "What does [process/workflow] look like at your company?"

**Examples**:
- "What does your hiring process look like?"
- "What does a typical customer implementation look like for you?"
- "What does your monthly reporting process look like?"

**Why it works**: Neutral framing, invites detailed response

---

**Template**: "How are you [handling problem area] today?"

**Examples**:
- "How are you handling sizing questions from customers today?"
- "How are you managing multi-cloud deployments today?"
- "How are you tracking customer health scores today?"

**Why it works**: Assumes they're already doing *something*, focuses on method

---

### Problem Exploration Questions

**Template**: "What's your biggest challenge with [problem area]?"

**Examples**:

**Examples**:
- "What kind of return rates are you seeing?" (assumes they have returns)
- "What churn patterns are you seeing?" (assumes they have churn)
- "What API error rates are you seeing?" (assumes they have errors)

**Why it works**: Assumes the problem exists, asks for severity

---

### Impact Questions

**Template**: "How does [problem] impact [business outcome]?"

**Examples**:
- "How do high return rates impact your unit economics?"
- "How does slow onboarding impact your customer LTV?"
- "How do data pipeline failures impact your reporting?"

**Why it works**: Connects problem to business value, surfaces urgency

---

**Template**: "How much [time/money/resource] does your team spend on [problem area]?"

**Examples**:
- "How much time does your team spend processing returns each week?"
- "How many support hours do you spend on implementation questions?"
- "How much budget goes to manual data reconciliation?"

**Why it works**: Quantifies the problem, enables ROI calculation later

---

### Priority Questions

**Template**: "Where does [problem area] fall on your priority list right now?"

**Examples**:
- "Where does improving customer experience fall on your roadmap?"
- "Where does sales efficiency fall on your priorities this quarter?"

**Why it works**: Surfaces urgency, helps qualify timing

```

### Soft Disqualifiers

**Template**: Ask these to deprioritize, not discard

**Problem Severity**:
```
Q: "What's your current [problem metric]?"

Example:
Q: "What's your return rate?"
~ Continue but deprioritize: 5-10% (problem exists but mild)
✓ Prioritize: 20%+ (severe problem)
```

**Timing**:
```
Q: "What's your timeline for addressing this?"

## Question Sequencing

### The BANT Framework (Classic)

**Budget**: "Do you have budget allocated?"
**Authority**: "Who else needs to be involved in the decision?"
**Need**: "What's your biggest challenge with [problem area]?"
**Timeline**: "When are you looking to implement a solution?"

**Modern variation**: Lead with Need, end with Timeline (less sales-y)

### The Challenger Sale Framework

1. **Teach**: Share insight about the problem
   - "Most brands your size see 20-30% return rates due to sizing issues. What are you seeing?"

2. **Tailor**: Customize to their situation
   - "With 500 orders/month, that's likely 100-150 returns to process. How is that impacting your ops team?"

3. **Take Control**: Direct the conversation
   - "Let me ask you a few quick questions to see if we're a fit..."

### The MEDDIC Framework (Enterprise)

**Metrics**: "What's your current [problem metric]?"
**Economic Buyer**: "Who controls the budget for this?"
**Decision Criteria**: "What factors will you evaluate solutions on?"
**Decision Process**: "Walk me through your procurement process."
**Identify Pain**: "What's the business impact of this problem?"
**Champion**: "Who internally would benefit most from solving this?"

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Leading Questions
❌ "You probably have issues with [problem], right?"
✓ "What challenges are you seeing with [area]?"

### Mistake 2: Too Many Open-Ended Questions

### Mistake 3: Asking Unmeasurable Questions
❌ "How important is customer experience to you?" (always "very important")
✓ "What's your NPS score?" or "How quickly do you respond to support tickets?"

### Mistake 4: Not Disqualifying Early
❌ 20-minute call before realizing they're on wrong platform
✓ Ask dealbreaker questions in first 3 minutes

### Mistake 5: Asking Without Listening
❌ Checklist mode, just getting through questions
✓ Listen to answers, ask follow-ups, build rapport
