# Observable Characteristics Guide

## Core Principle

**Observable**: Can be verified through public data or simple yes/no question
**Psychographic**: Requires interpretation, judgment, or assumption about mindset

## The Observability Test

Ask yourself: **"Could two sales reps independently identify this characteristic and agree 95% of the time?"**

- If YES → Observable ✓
- If NO → Psychographic ❌

## Examples by Category

### Company Size

#### ✓ Observable
- "50-200 employees" (LinkedIn, company website)
- "$2M-$15M annual revenue" (Crunchbase estimates)
- "10-50 person engineering team" (LinkedIn dept. size)
- "3-8 person customer success team" (LinkedIn)
- "Single office location" (LinkedIn, website)
- "2-5 founders listed on About page"

#### ❌ Psychographic
- "Small but mighty teams"
- "Lean and agile organizations"
- "Right-sized for growth"
- "Scrappy startups"

**Why the difference?**: "50-200 employees" appears on LinkedIn. "Scrappy startups" requires interpretation.

---

### Industry/Vertical

#### ✓ Observable
- "NAICS code 448 (Clothing and Apparel Stores)"
- "E-commerce apparel retailers"
- "B2B SaaS companies"
- "Listed on G2 in 'Marketing Automation' category"
- "Member of National Retail Federation"
- "FinTech companies with banking licenses"

#### ❌ Psychographic
- "Innovative industries"
- "Forward-thinking sectors"
- "Disruptive verticals"
- "Fast-moving markets"

**Why the difference?**: NAICS codes and G2 categories are standardized. "Innovative industries" is subjective.

---

### Geography

#### ✓ Observable

- "US-based with >70% US traffic" (SimilarWeb)
- "Shipping to US, CA, UK only" (website shipping page)
- "English as primary website language"
- "Office in San Francisco Bay Area" (LinkedIn)

#### ❌ Psychographic
- "Companies in innovation hubs"
- "Markets with sophisticated buyers"
- "Progressive regions"
- "Tech-forward cities"

**Why the difference?**: Geographic location is factual. "Innovation hubs" is interpretive.

---

### Technology Stack

- "Has Salesforce CRM" (job postings, LinkedIn tech mentions)

- "AWS infrastructure" (job postings, tech stack page)

#### ❌ Psychographic
- "Modern tech stack"
- "Cutting-edge technology"
- "Best-in-class tools"
- "Enterprise-grade systems"

**Why the difference?**: Specific technologies are detectable. "Modern" is subjective and changes over time.

---

### Growth & Maturity

#### ✓ Observable

---

## Exercise: Convert Your Canvas

Take your Canvas customer segment description and convert it:

**Example Canvas Segment**:
> "We target innovative, customer-obsessed fashion brands that are rapidly growing and care deeply about the online shopping experience."

**Step 1: Identify psychographics**
- "Innovative" → psychographic
- "Customer-obsessed" → psychographic
- "Rapidly growing" → vague
- "Care deeply about..." → psychographic

**Step 2: Convert to observable**
1. Innovative →
   - Filed design patents
   - Won fashion industry awards (CFDA, etc.)
   - Featured in fashion tech publications

2. Customer-obsessed →
   - CS team >10 people
   - Responds to reviews <24 hours
   - Published customer testimonials

3. Rapidly growing →
   - 30%+ headcount growth (LinkedIn)
   - Raised funding in last 12 months
   - Hiring for 5+ roles

4. Care about shopping experience →
   - Uses premium Shopify theme or custom design
   - Has size/fit quiz on product pages
   - Offers virtual try-on or AR

**Step 3: Write ICP**
```yaml
firmographics:
  industry: "Fashion & Apparel (NAICS 448)"
  company_size: "20-150 employees"
  geography: "US, CA, UK"

technographics:
  required: "Shopify or custom e-commerce platform"
  signals:
    - "Premium Shopify theme ($300+) or custom design"
    - "Interactive fit quiz on product pages"

growth_signals:
  - "30%+ headcount growth in last 6 months"
  - "Raised Seed/Series A in last 12 months"
  - "5+ open roles currently"

customer_focus_signals:
  - "CS team >10 people or >8% of headcount"
  - "Responds to Trustpilot reviews <24 hours"
  - "Customer testimonials on homepage"

innovation_signals:
  - "Design patents or fashion awards"
  - "Featured in fashion tech press (WWD, Glossy)"
```
