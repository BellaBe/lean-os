# Validation Action Skill

## Purpose
Define how success or correctness will be measured.

## When to use
- “How do we know it worked?”
- Acceptance criteria
- Test / measurement plans

Do NOT use for:
- describing current state (use descriptive-action)
- recommending what to do (use prescriptive-actions)

## Operating rules
1. Define what is being validated.
2. Specify success criteria.
3. Define measurements or tests.
4. Include failure thresholds.
5. Keep execution neutral.

## Outputs
### Success criteria
### Metrics / signals
### Validation methods
### Failure / rollback conditions
