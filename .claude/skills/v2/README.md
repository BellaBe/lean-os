# V2 Engineering Skills (Active)

**Status:** Active - Current version
**Updated:** December 2025

## What This Contains

V2 engineering skills use a 12-level categorical architecture:

### Orchestrators

- `engineering/` - Main orchestrator with 12-level pipeline
- `engineering-code-architect/` - Code generation from specs
- `engineering-maps-architect/` - Language-agnostic patterns
- `engineering-proofs-architect/` - Formal verification with Lean 4
- `engineering-standards-architect/` - Cross-cutting standards

### Level Skills (inside engineering/)

| Level | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| L0 | Primitives (base types, operations) |
| L1 | Domain objects |
| L2 | Transformations |
| L3 | Validation |
| L4 | State management |
| L5 | Artifacts (outputs, persistence) |
| L6 | API composition |
| L7 | Workflows |
| L8 | Integration |
| L9 | Code implementation |
| L10 | Testing |
| L11 | Infrastructure |

## Key Features

- **Manifest-driven** - Every level validates completeness
- **Traceability** - Full lineage from L0 to L11
- **Language-agnostic** - Maps layer abstracts implementation
- **Proof integration** - Lean 4 verification at each level

## Usage

Invoke via the `engineering/` orchestrator for full pipeline, or individual architect skills for specific tasks.
