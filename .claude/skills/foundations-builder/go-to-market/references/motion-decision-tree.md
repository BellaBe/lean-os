# GTM Motion Decision Tree

## Start Here

### Q1: Where do customers discover solutions like yours?

**A: App store / Marketplace / Platform**
→ Partner-Led motion
→ Primary channel: The platform itself
→ STOP

**B: Search engines / Content / Social**
→ Go to Q2

**C: Sales conversations / Events / Referrals**
→ Go to Q3

---

### Q2: Can customers self-serve?

**A: Yes — they can sign up, try, buy without talking to anyone**
→ PLG motion
→ Primary channel: Product (free tier, trial, freemium)

**B: Partially — they need some education but can convert online**
→ Content-Led motion
→ Primary channel: Content (blog, social, SEO) with sales-assist for conversion

**C: No — they need demo, consultation, or committee approval**
→ Go to Q3

---

### Q3: What's your typical deal size?

**A: <$10K ACV**
→ PLG or Content-Led
→ Inbound-focused, self-serve where possible

**B: $10K-$50K ACV**
→ Content-Led with Sales-Assist
→ Inbound + targeted outbound

**C: >$50K ACV**
→ Full SLG
→ Outbound, ABM, enterprise sales team

| SLG | High ACV, complex sale | Outbound, Events | Heavy |
| Hybrid | Multiple segments with different needs | Mix | Varies by segment |

## Motion Details

### PLG (Product-Led Growth)

**Characteristics:**
- Self-serve signup/onboarding
- Free tier or freemium model
- In-product upsells
- Low/no touch sales initially
- Virality/network effects built in

**Examples:** Slack, Figma, Notion, Calendly

**Ceiling:** Nobody self-serves to $1M deals. Layer in sales as you move upmarket.

### Content-Led Growth

**Characteristics:**
- Educational content drives awareness
- SEO/social drives traffic
- Lead magnets capture interest
- Sales assists conversion
- Authority builds trust

**Examples:** HubSpot (inbound), Ahrefs, many B2B SaaS

**Note:** Requires consistent content production. Works best with founder voice.

### Partner-Led Growth

**Characteristics:**
- Platform handles distribution
- App store / marketplace listing
- Reviews drive social proof
- Rankings drive discovery
- Platform rules constrain

**Examples:** Shopify apps, Salesforce AppExchange, Chrome extensions

**Key insight:** Don't fight the platform. Optimize for platform mechanics.

### SLG (Sales-Led Growth)

**Characteristics:**
- Outbound prospecting (SDRs)
- Discovery calls, demos, POCs
- Contract negotiation
- Longer sales cycles
- Higher deal sizes

**Examples:** Salesforce, Workday, enterprise SaaS

**When it makes sense:** Enterprise from day 1, complex products, high ACV justifies CAC.

### Hybrid

**When to use:**
- Multiple customer segments with different needs
- SMB self-serve + Enterprise sales
- Platform distribution + direct content

**How to manage:** Define primary motion per segment. Don't try to do everything at once.

## Common Mistakes

### 1. PLG for enterprise products
- Nobody self-serves to $1M deals
- Add sales earlier than you think
- Signal: Large accounts churning or not expanding

### 2. SLG for SMB products
- CAC too high for deal size
- Build self-serve first
- Signal: Long sales cycles, low close rates

### 3. Ignoring platform distribution
- If customers are already on a platform (Shopify, Salesforce), meet them there
- Don't fight the platform
- Signal: Competitors growing faster via platform

### 4. Too many channels too early
- Prove one channel first
- Add second only when primary is working
- Signal: No channel has predictable CAC

### 5. Content-Led without consistency
- Authority requires sustained presence
- Sporadic posting doesn't compound
- Signal: No inbound despite content

## Stage Progression

Most companies evolve their motion:

```
Startup → PLG or Partner-Led (low friction)
    ↓
Scale → Add Sales-Assisted (larger accounts)
    ↓
Growth → Full motion mix (segmented)
    ↓
Mature → Optimized channel portfolio
```

**Trigger to add sales:** When you see accounts that could pay more but aren't converting or expanding via self-serve.
