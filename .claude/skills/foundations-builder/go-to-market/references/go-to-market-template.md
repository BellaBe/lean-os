## GTM Motion

**Type:** {PLG | Content-Led | Partner-Led | SLG | Hybrid}

**Rationale:**
- ACV: ${X} → {supports motion because...}
- Buyer: {user/champion/committee/marketplace} → {supports motion because...}
- Complexity: {low/medium/high} → {supports motion because...}
- Distribution: {direct/platform} → {supports motion because...}

## Current Stage

**Stage:** {Pre-launch | Launch | Growth | Scale}

**Stage Definition:**
- Pre-launch: Validating channel fit
- Launch (0-10K MRR): Proving CAC on primary channel
- Growth (10-100K MRR): Scaling primary, testing secondary
- Scale (100K+ MRR): Optimizing mix, adding channels

**Stage Goals:**
- {Goal 1}
- {Goal 2}
- {Goal 3}

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| {metric} | {value} | {target} |

**Owner:** {who}

---

### Secondary: {Channel Name}

**Investment:** MEDIUM

**Status:** {Active | Testing | Planned}

**Why Secondary:**
{Rationale}

**Activities:**
- {Activity 1}

### Dormant/Future: {Channel Name}

**Status:** DORMANT

**Activation Trigger:**
{When to activate this channel}

---

## Growth Loops

### Primary Loop: {Name}

```
{Trigger}
    ↓
{Action}
    ↓
{Amplification}
    ↓
{New acquisition}
    ↓
Loop continues
```

**Loop Metrics:**
- Cycle time: {how long one loop takes}
- Participation rate: {what % engage}
- Viral coefficient: {K value if applicable}

---

## Evolution Plan

### Next Stage Trigger

Move from {current stage} to {next stage} when:
- {Condition 1}
- {Condition 2}

### Channel Addition Criteria

Add secondary channel when:
- Primary CAC < ${X}
- Primary conversion > {X}%
- Primary volume > {X}/month

### Channel Removal Criteria

Remove/pause channel when:
- CAC > ${X} for 4 weeks
- Conversion < {X}% for 4 weeks
- No improvement after optimization
