## Company Stage Adjustments

### Startup / Seed Stage (<20 employees)

**Typical structure**:
- Founder/Co-Founder (wears all hats)
- Maybe 1 C-level hire (CTO or CMO)
- No middle management

**Contact strategy**:
- Always target Founder first
- Founder is economic + technical buyer
- No need to map multiple personas

### Early Stage / Series A (20-50 employees)

**Typical structure**:
- CEO + 2-3 C-level (CTO, CMO, or COO)
- 1-2 VPs or Directors
- Few managers

**Contact strategy**:
- Target relevant C-level (CMO for marketing tools)
- CEO still involved in major purchases
- Directors have evaluation authority, not budget

### Growth Stage / Series B+ (50-200 employees)

**Typical structure**:
- Full C-suite
- VP layer (multiple VPs)
- Director layer (multiple Directors per function)
- Manager layer

**Contact strategy**:
- Target VP-level (budget authority for function)
- Director-level for technical evaluation
- C-level for strategic/large deals

### Enterprise (200+ employees)

**Typical structure**:
- C-suite (rarely accessible)
- SVP layer
- VP layer (primary decision-makers)
- Director/Manager layer (end users)

**Contact strategy**:
- Target VP-level (functional budget owner)
- SVP for large/strategic deals
- Director for technical evaluation and champion

## Multi-Decision-Maker Products

### When to Contact Multiple Personas

**Product requires technical + business buy-in**:
- Example: Compliance software (Compliance Officer + CFO)
- Strategy: Contact Compliance Officer first (champion), then CFO (budget)

**Product has end-user adoption requirement**:
- Example: CRM (Sales VP + Sales Reps)
- Strategy: Contact Sales VP first (decision-maker), demo with Sales Reps (users)

**Product impacts multiple departments**:
- Example: E-commerce app (Ecommerce Director + Customer Service + Marketing)
- Strategy: Contact Ecommerce Director first (primary), involve others in demo

### Decision-Making Process Mapping

**Single decision-maker** (small companies):
- Founder/CEO approves all purchases
- Contact: 1 person
- Sales cycle: Short (1-2 calls)

**Two decision-makers** (medium companies):
- Budget owner + Technical evaluator
- Contact: 2 people (sequentially)
- Sales cycle: Medium (3-4 calls)

**Committee decision** (large companies):
- Budget owner + Technical evaluator + End users + Procurement
- Contact: 3-5 people (start with champion)
- Sales cycle: Long (6+ calls, 3-6 months)

## Title Research Quality Indicators

### High Confidence Signals

**LinkedIn profile shows**:
- Current position at target company
- Recent activity (posts/comments in last 30 days)
- 500+ connections
- Complete profile (photo, headline, experience)
- Relevant keywords in headline/about

### Medium Confidence Signals

**LinkedIn profile shows**:
- Current position at target company
- Some activity (last 90 days)
- 100-500 connections
- Mostly complete profile

### Low Confidence Signals

**LinkedIn profile shows**:
- Outdated position (possibly left company)
- No activity (inactive account)
- <100 connections
- Incomplete profile (no photo, minimal info)

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Contacting Too Junior

**Wrong**: Contacting Manager-level for $50K+ purchase
**Right**: Contact VP-level or Director-level (budget authority)

**Example**:
- ✗ "Marketing Manager" for $60K marketing automation tool
- ✓ "VP Marketing" or "CMO" (has budget)

### Mistake 2: Contacting Too Senior

**Wrong**: Contacting CEO for $5K/year tool (waste of time)
**Right**: Contact functional leader (Director or VP)

**Example**:
- ✗ "CEO" for $5K customer service tool
- ✓ "Head of Customer Service" (owns function)

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Company Size

**Wrong**: Using same titles for startup and enterprise
**Right**: Adjust title search based on company size

**Example**:
- Startup (30 people): Target "Founder" not "CMO"
- Enterprise (500 people): Target "VP Marketing" not "CEO"

### Mistake 4: Multiple Buyers, Wrong Order

**Wrong**: Contacting CFO first for technical product
**Right**: Contact technical buyer first (champion), then CFO

**Example**:
- Compliance software: Compliance Officer first (expert), CFO second (budget)
- Not: CFO first (doesn't understand problem)

## Search Pattern Examples

### Search Progression (if primary title yields no results)

**Example: Marketing automation tool for 80-person company**

1st attempt:
```
site:linkedin.com/in "{Company}" "CMO"
```

2nd attempt (if no CMO):
```
site:linkedin.com/in "{Company}" "VP Marketing"
```

3rd attempt (if no VP):
```
site:linkedin.com/in "{Company}" "Director of Marketing"
```

4th attempt (if no Director):
```
site:linkedin.com/in "{Company}" "Marketing Manager"
```

**Stop if**: Only Manager-level found and product >$20K (likely too junior)

### Alternative Title Searches
