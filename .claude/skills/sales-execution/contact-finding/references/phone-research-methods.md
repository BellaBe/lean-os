# Phone Research Methods

## Overview

Systematic methods for finding phone contact information for B2B decision-makers, following Pete Kazanjy's principle that phone outreach is critical for high-value B2B sales.

**IMPORTANT**: This guide documents WHERE to find phone information and WHEN to call. It does NOT advocate scraping private phone numbers or unsolicited mobile calls.

## Why Phone Matters (Pete Kazanjy Framework)

### Phone > Email for B2B

**Statistics**:
- Email open rate: 15-25% (B2B cold)
- Phone connection rate: 5-10% (but higher quality)
- Voicemail callback rate: 1-3%
- Email + Phone combo: 3x higher response vs email only

**Key principle**: "The phone is not dead, salespeople who don't call are dead"

### Phone Call Value Hierarchy

**Highest value**: Direct line to decision-maker
**High value**: Company main line, ask for decision-maker
**Medium value**: Department line (sales, support)
**Low value**: General inquiry line (receptionists, gatekeepers)

**Goal**: Get to decision-maker conversation, not leave voicemails

## Phone Research Methods

### Method 1: Company Website Contact Page

**Search query**:
```
site:{domain} "phone" OR "call" OR "contact us"
```

**What to look for**:
- Main company phone number
- Department-specific numbers
- Office locations with local numbers
- International numbers (if multiple offices)

**Example findings**:
```
Contact Us page shows:
Main: +1 (555) 123-4567
Sales: +1 (555) 123-4568
Support: +1 (555) 123-4569

Research output: "Company phone: +1 (555) 123-4567 (website contact page)"
```

**Confidence**:
- Main + department numbers: **High confidence** (can route to decision-maker)
- Main only: **Medium confidence** (may have gatekeeper)
- No phone on website: **Low confidence** (need alternative method)

**Usage strategy**:
- Call main line
- Ask for decision-maker by name: "Hi, I'm trying to reach Sarah Johnson, is she available?"
- If name unknown, ask by title: "Hi, I'm trying to reach your CMO, could you connect me?"

### Method 2: LinkedIn Company Page

**Search query**:
```
site:linkedin.com/company "{company name}"
```

**What to look for**:
- Company page "About" section
- Phone number listed
- Office locations with contact info

**Example findings**:
```
LinkedIn company page shows:
Phone: +1 (555) 123-4567
Website: company.com
Locations: San Francisco, CA

Research output: "Company phone: +1 (555) 123-4567 (LinkedIn company page)"
```

**Confidence**:
- Phone on LinkedIn: **High confidence** (verified, up-to-date)
- No phone on LinkedIn: **N/A** (try other methods)

**Usage strategy**:
- Same as company website (main line routing)

### Method 3: LinkedIn Individual Profile (Contact Info)

**Search query**:
```
site:linkedin.com/in "{person name}" "{company}"
```

**What to look for**:
- Profile "Contact Info" section
- Phone number (if visible)
- Note: Most profiles hide phone (privacy setting)

**Example findings**:
```
LinkedIn profile shows:
Sarah Johnson - CMO at Company
Contact Info:
- Email: sarah.johnson@company.com
- Phone: +1 (555) 987-6543

Research output: "Direct line: Available on LinkedIn profile"
```

**Confidence**:
- Phone visible on profile: **Very high confidence** (person chose to share)
- Phone not visible: **N/A** (privacy setting)

**Usage strategy**:
- Only use if person has made phone public (respects privacy)
- Direct line likely, not company main line

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT scrape or guess phone numbers. Only document if publicly visible.

### Method 4: Business Directories

**General directories**:
- Google Business Profile (Google Maps)
- Yelp (for some B2B)
- Better Business Bureau
- Chamber of Commerce listings

**Search queries**:
```
"{company name}" phone number
"{company name}" Google Business
"{company name}" chamber of commerce
```

**Example findings**:
```
Google Business shows:
Company Name
+1 (555) 123-4567
Open Mon-Fri 9am-5pm

Research output: "Company phone: +1 (555) 123-4567 (Google Business)"
```

**Confidence**:
- Multiple directories show same number: **High confidence**
- Single directory: **Medium confidence**
- Conflicting numbers: **Low confidence** (verify which is current)

**Usage strategy**:
- Company main line, route to decision-maker

### Method 5: Industry-Specific Databases

**Financial Services (RIA/Advisory)**:
- SEC IARD database (Investment Advisor Public Disclosure)
- FINRA BrokerCheck
- State regulatory databases

**Search queries**:
```
site:adviserinfo.sec.gov "{company name}"
"{company name}" IARD
```

**Example findings**:
```
SEC IARD shows:
Firm Name: Advisory Partners LLC
Business Phone: +1 (555) 123-4567
Location: 123 Main St, New York, NY

Research output: "Company phone: +1 (555) 123-4567 (SEC IARD database)"
```

**Healthcare**:
- State medical licensing boards
- Hospital/practice directories
- CMS provider databases

**Legal**:
- State bar associations
- Martindale-Hubbell
- Court filing databases

**Real Estate**:

- Property records

**Confidence**: **High confidence** (regulatory/official databases, verified)

### Method 6: Press Releases and Media Mentions

**Search queries**:
```
"{company name}" "press" OR "media" phone
"{company name}" "contact" OR "inquiries"
```

**What to look for**:
- Press release contact section
- Media inquiry phone numbers
- Public relations contact info

**Example findings**:
```
Press release shows:
For media inquiries, contact:
Sarah Johnson, CMO
+1 (555) 987-6543
sarah.johnson@company.com

Research output: "PR contact phone available in press releases"
```

**Confidence**:
- Recent press release (<6 months): **Medium confidence**
- Old press release (>1 year): **Low confidence** (person may have left)

**Usage strategy**:
- PR contact may not be decision-maker
- Use to verify company main line or get routed to right person

### Method 7: Job Postings

**Search queries**:
```
site:lever.co OR site:greenhouse.io "{company name}" phone
"{company name}" jobs contact
```

**What to look for**:
- Recruiter contact phone
- Hiring manager phone (rare)
- Company main line in application instructions

**Example findings**:
```
Job posting shows:
Questions about this role? Contact:
Recruiting Team: +1 (555) 123-4567

Research output: "Company phone: +1 (555) 123-4567 (from job postings)"
```

**Confidence**: **Medium confidence** (usually main line or HR, not direct to decision-maker)

## Phone Research Strategy

### When Phone NOT Found

**Output in CSV**:
```csv
phone_research_method
"Not found - will need discovery call to company main line"
"Not found - LinkedIn message as alternative"
"Not found - email first, request call"
```

**Alternative strategies**:
- Send email first, request call in email
- LinkedIn message requesting best number to reach them
- Twitter/social DM (less formal industries)
- Referral/introduction from mutual connection (ask for number)

## When to Call (Timing Strategy)

### Best Times to Call B2B Decision-Makers

**By time of day**:
- **8:00-9:00am**: Before administrative staff arrive (higher chance of direct answer)
- **12:00-1:00pm**: Lunch hour (may still be at desk)
- **5:00-6:00pm**: After administrative staff leave (higher chance of direct answer)

**Worst times**:
- 9:00-10:00am: Morning meetings
- 10:00am-12:00pm: Peak work time (busy)
- 2:00-3:00pm: Post-lunch meetings
- 4:00-5:00pm: Wrapping up day (busy)

**By day of week**:
- **Tuesday-Thursday**: Best days (Monday = busy, Friday = checked out)
- **Monday**: Worst day (catching up from weekend)
- **Friday**: Bad day (winding down, leaving early)

**By decision-maker level**:
- **C-level**: Early morning (7:30-8:30am) or late (5:30-6:30pm)
- **VP-level**: Mid-morning (9:00-10:00am) or early afternoon (1:00-2:00pm)
- **Director/Manager**: More flexible, follow general guidelines

### By Industry

**Financial Services (RIA/Advisor)**:
- Best: Tuesday-Thursday 8:00-9:00am (before client meetings)
- Avoid: Market hours (client interactions), Fridays (often off)

**E-commerce/Retail**:
- Best: Tuesday-Thursday 10:00-11:00am
- Avoid: Monday (weekend order processing), weekends (operational)

**SaaS/Tech**:
- Best: Tuesday-Thursday 9:00-10:00am or 4:00-5:00pm
- Flexible hours (many work late)

**Healthcare**:
- Best: Tuesday-Thursday 12:00-1:00pm (between patient appointments)
- Avoid: Early morning (rounds), late afternoon (administrative work)

**Manufacturing**:
- Best: Tuesday-Thursday 7:00-8:00am (early starters)
- Avoid: Production hours (on factory floor)

## Calling Scripts and Gatekeepers

### Script 1: Calling Company Main Line (Know Decision-Maker Name)

**Example**:
```
You: "Hi, I'm trying to reach Sarah Johnson, is she available?"

Gatekeeper: "May I ask what this is regarding?"

You: "Yes, I'm [Your Name] from [Your Company]. We work with e-commerce brands on [problem], and I wanted to have a quick conversation with Sarah about an approach that's working for similar companies. Is she available?"

Gatekeeper: "Let me transfer you" OR "She's not available, can I take a message?"

You (if message): "Sure, could you let her know [Your Name] called about [specific problem/opportunity]? My number is XXX-XXX-XXXX. When's the best time to reach her?"
```

**Key points**:
- Use decision-maker first name (informal, less sales-y)
- Mention specific problem (shows research)
- Reference similar companies (social proof)
- Get best time to call back

### Script 2: Calling Company Main Line (Don't Know Name, Know Title)

**Example**:
```
You: "Hi, I'm trying to reach your CMO, could you connect me?"

Gatekeeper: "That's Sarah Johnson. May I ask what this is regarding?"

[Follow Script 1]
```

**Key points**:
- Ask for title, not "who is your CMO?" (less sales-y)
- Once you get name, use it in conversation
- Follow up with email mentioning you called

### Script 3: Leaving Voicemail

**Example**:
```
"Hi {FirstName}, this is [Your Name] from [Your Company]. I work with {target segment} like {Company A} and {Company B} to {achieve outcome} by {X}% using {solution approach}. I noticed {Company} has a great {current approach} already, and I wanted to share a quick idea on how to take it to the next level. My number is XXX-XXX-XXXX, or feel free to email me at [email]. I'll follow up with an email as well. Thanks!"
```

**Key points**:
- Keep under 30 seconds
- Mention specific problem/result
- Name-drop similar companies (social proof)
- Provide email as alternative
- Mention you'll follow up (permission to email)

### Script 4: Calling Decision-Maker Directly (LinkedIn Profile Phone)

**Example**:
```
You: "Hi {FirstName}, this is [Your Name] from [Your Company]. I hope I'm not catching you at a bad time?"

[If bad time: "No worries, when's a better time to reach you?" Then call back]

You: "I saw your profile on LinkedIn and wanted to reach out because we work with {Role plural} at {target segment} to {achieve outcome}. I noticed {Company} has {specific observation}, and I thought you might be interested in a quick conversation about an approach that's working for similar {industry}. Do you have 5 minutes?"
```

**Key points**:
- Acknowledge you found them on LinkedIn (transparency)
- Ask if it's a bad time (respectful)
- Specific observation (shows research)
- Time-bound ask (5 minutes, not open-ended)

## Phone Research Quality Checklist

**Before outputting phone research, verify**:
- [ ] Phone number is from public source (not scraped/guessed)
- [ ] Source is documented (website, LinkedIn, directory)
- [ ] Confidence level matches source quality
- [ ] If no phone found, alternative documented (email first, LinkedIn message)
- [ ] No personal/mobile numbers included (privacy)
- [ ] Compliance check: B2B context, business hours, opt-out honored

**Red flags requiring manual review**:
- Multiple conflicting phone numbers (which is current?)
- No public phone found (need alternative strategy)
- Only mobile number found (may be personal, privacy concern)
- International numbers (check timezone, calling hours)

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Over-Relying on Phone (Ignoring Email)

**Wrong**: Only calling, no email follow-up
**Right**: Multi-channel approach (call + email + LinkedIn)

**Example**:
- ✗ Call 5 times, never send email (annoying)
- ✓ Call 2 times, send email, LinkedIn message (persistent but respectful)

### Mistake 2: Calling at Bad Times

**Wrong**: Calling Monday 9am or Friday 4pm (busy/checked out)
**Right**: Calling Tuesday-Thursday 8-9am or 5-6pm (off-hours)

**Example**:
- ✗ Call CMO at 2pm Tuesday (busy time, low answer rate)
- ✓ Call CMO at 8am Tuesday (before meetings, high answer rate)

### Mistake 3: Not Researching Before Calling

**Wrong**: Calling with generic pitch, no company research
**Right**: Mention specific observation about their company (shows effort)

**Example**:
- ✗ "Hi, we help e-commerce companies..." (generic)
- ✓ "Hi Sarah, I noticed ChicThreads has a great sizing guide, and..." (personalized)

### Mistake 4: Giving Up After 1 Attempt

**Wrong**: Call once, no answer, never try again
**Right**: Call 2-3 times at different times, leave 1 voicemail, follow up with email

**Example**:
- ✗ Call Tuesday 10am, no answer, give up
- ✓ Call Tuesday 8am, Wednesday 5pm, Thursday 9am + voicemail + email

**Pete Kazanjy recommendation**: "The average B2B deal requires 8-12 touches. Most salespeople give up after 2."

### Mistake 5: Not Using Gatekeepers Strategically

**Wrong**: Being rude to receptionist/admin (they control access!)
**Right**: Being friendly, asking for help, building rapport

**Example**:
- ✗ "Just transfer me to Sarah" (demanding, rude)
- ✓ "I'm hoping to reach Sarah, when's usually a good time to catch her?" (asking for help)

**Pro tip**: Gatekeepers remember friendly callers. Be nice!
