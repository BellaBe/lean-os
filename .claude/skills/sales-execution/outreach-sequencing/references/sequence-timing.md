# Sequence Timing Patterns

## Overview

Day-by-day timing patterns for multi-touch outreach sequences based on Pete Kazanjy's founding sales framework and modern B2B SaaS best practices.

## Standard Sequence (Day 0/3/7/10/14/21)

### Timing Breakdown

**Day 0: Initial Email**
- **When**: Tuesday or Wednesday
- **Time**: 10:00am local time (prospect's timezone)
- **Why Tuesday/Wednesday**: Highest open rates (Monday = busy, Friday = checked out)
- **Why 10am**: After morning email check (9am), before lunch (12pm)

**Day 3: Follow-up #1** (+3 days)
- **When**: Same day as Day 0 (if Day 0 = Tuesday, Day 3 = Friday)
- **Time**: Same time as Day 0 (10:00am)
- **Why 3 days**: Enough time for prospect to see initial email, not too long to forget
- **Content shift**: Add value (case study, insight, stat)

**Day 7: Follow-up #2** (+4 days)
- **When**: Same day as Day 0 (next week Tuesday if Day 0 = Tuesday)
- **Time**: Same time as Day 0 (10:00am)
- **Why 7 days**: One week from initial (easy to remember), second reminder
- **Content shift**: Different problem angle (approach from alternative pain point)

**Day 10: Phone Call** (+3 days)
- **When**: Tuesday-Thursday (avoid Monday/Friday)
- **Time**: 8:00-9:00am OR 5:00-6:00pm (off-hours for higher answer rate)
- **Why 10 days**: After 3 emails, enough touchpoints to establish familiarity
- **Content shift**: Voice conversation, qualify fit, schedule demo

**Day 14: Break-up Email** (+4 days)
- **When**: Same day as Day 0 (two weeks from initial)
- **Time**: Same time as Day 0 (10:00am)
- **Why 14 days**: Two weeks = professional patience, 4 prior touchpoints (3 emails + 1 call)
- **Content shift**: Permission-based close, easy out or easy in

**Day 21: Final Touch** (+7 days) [Conditional]
- **When**: Same day as Day 0 (three weeks from initial)
- **Time**: Same time as Day 0 (10:00am)
- **Why 21 days**: One more chance after break-up, full 3-week cycle
- **Condition**: Only if relevant case study or proof point available
- **Content shift**: Pure value delivery (no ask)

### When to Use Standard Sequence

**Best for**:
- Cold outreach to new prospects (no prior engagement)
- Mid-market companies (50-500 employees)
- Standard sales cycle (30-60 days from first touch to close)
- B2B SaaS products ($10K-$100K ACV)

**Success metrics**:
- Email open rate: 40-60%
- Email reply rate: 8-12%
- Phone answer rate: 5-10%
- Meeting booked: 3-5%

**Total touches**: 5-6 (3 emails + 1 call + 1 break-up + 1 final touch)
**Total duration**: 21 days

## Aggressive Sequence (Day 0/2/4/7/10/14)

### Timing Breakdown

**Day 0: Initial Email**
- Same as standard (Tuesday/Wednesday 10am)

**Day 2: Follow-up #1** (+2 days)
- **When**: 2 days after Day 0 (Thursday if Day 0 = Tuesday)
- **Time**: Same time (10:00am)

**Day 4: Follow-up #2** (+2 days)
- **When**: 2 days after Day 2 (next Monday if Day 2 = Thursday)
- **Time**: Same time (10:00am)
- **Why 4 days**: Another quick follow-up, maintain momentum
- **Content shift**: Different angle (3rd email in 5 days = varied content needed)

**Day 7: Phone Call** (+3 days)
- **When**: Tuesday-Thursday
- **Time**: 8:00-9:00am OR 5:00-6:00pm
- **Why 7 days**: Earlier phone call (after 3 emails in 7 days)
- **Content shift**: Strike while iron is hot

**Day 10: Follow-up #3** (+3 days)
- **When**: Same day pattern
- **Time**: Same time (10:00am)
- **Why 10 days**: Post-phone follow-up, not quite break-up yet

**Day 14: Final Touch / Break-up** (+4 days)
- **When**: Two weeks from initial
- **Time**: Same time (10:00am)
- **Why 14 days**: Earlier close-out (aggressive timeline)
- **Content shift**: Break-up or final value delivery

### When to Use Aggressive Sequence

**Best for**:

**Warning signs to avoid**:
- Completely cold list (no prior engagement) → Too aggressive
- C-level executives (very busy) → Feels pushy
- Very long sales cycles (6+ months) → No urgency

**Success metrics** (higher than standard):
- Email reply rate: 12-18% (hot leads)
- Phone answer rate: 10-15% (expecting your call)

## Timing Variations by Persona

### Founder / CEO (Small Companies)

**Recommended**: Standard or Aggressive (they move fast)

**Timing adjustments**:
- Call on Day 7 instead of Day 10 (earlier call, they answer more)
- Compress to 14-day cycle (fast decision-makers)
- Send emails early morning (7-8am) - they're early starters

**Rationale**: Founders are hands-on, move fast, appreciate directness

### CFO / Finance

**Recommended**: Standard or Patient (they're methodical)

**Timing adjustments**:
- Avoid month-end (last 5 days of month = closing books, very busy)
- Avoid January (budget planning, tax season prep)
- Send emails mid-morning (10-11am) - after morning finance meetings
- Call on Day 15 instead of Day 10 (more time to evaluate)

**Rationale**: CFOs are analytical, need time to evaluate ROI

### CMO / Marketing

**Recommended**: Standard (balanced approach)

**Timing adjustments**:
- Send emails Tuesday-Thursday (Monday = planning, Friday = reports)
- Call on Day 10 (standard timing works well)
- Reference metrics in emails (open rate, reply rate data)

**Rationale**: CMOs are data-driven, appreciate well-timed outreach

### CTO / Technical

**Recommended**: Patient (they're busy, skeptical of sales)

**Timing adjustments**:
- Send emails with technical content (architecture, integration, security)
- Call on Day 15-21 (later call, after they've researched)
- Offer technical demo first (not business value pitch)

**Rationale**: CTOs hate sales pitches, want technical details first

### VP / Director-Level

**Recommended**: Standard (most common persona)

**Timing adjustments**:
- Follow standard Day 0/3/7/10/14/21 pattern
- Call on Day 10 (sweet spot for mid-level)
- Send emails mid-morning (10am)

**Rationale**: VP/Directors are primary B2B buyers, standard works best

## Sequence Interval Patterns

### Gap Analysis

**2-day gaps** (Aggressive):
- Day 0 → Day 2 → Day 4
- Fast follow-up
- High frequency
- Risk: Feels spammy if prospect not interested

**3-day gaps** (Standard):
- Day 0 → Day 3 → Day 7 (3 days, then 4 days)
- Balanced cadence
- Professional patience
- Best for: Most B2B outreach

**5-day gaps** (Patient):
- Day 0 → Day 5 → Day 10 → Day 15
- Slow and steady
- Relationship-building
- Best for: Cold outreach, senior executives

**7-day gaps** (Very Patient):
- Day 0 → Day 7 → Day 14 → Day 21
- Weekly touchpoints
- Very respectful
- Best for: Strategic accounts, very cold lists

### Optimal Pattern

**Research shows** (Pete Kazanjy, Predictable Revenue):
- **3-day initial follow-up** performs best (Day 0 → Day 3)
- **4-day second follow-up** maintains momentum (Day 3 → Day 7)
- **3-day to phone call** bridges email to voice (Day 7 → Day 10)
- **4-day to break-up** gives time to respond (Day 10 → Day 14)

**Pattern**: 3 → 4 → 3 → 4 = Standard Sequence (Day 0/3/7/10/14)

---

## Sequence Duration

### Short (7-14 days)

**Aggressive sequence**: Day 0/2/4/7/10/14

**Best for**:
- Hot leads (inbound, referrals)
- Fast decision cycles (SMB, small deals)
- Urgent problems (compliance deadline, competitor switch)

**Risk**: May feel pushy if prospect not ready

### Medium (14-21 days)

**Standard sequence**: Day 0/3/7/10/14/21

**Best for**:
- Most B2B SaaS outreach
- Mid-market companies (50-500 employees)
- Standard sales cycles (30-60 days)

**Risk**: Balanced (not too fast, not too slow)

### Long (21-30 days)

**Patient sequence**: Day 0/5/10/15/21/30

**Best for**:
- Cold outreach (no prior engagement)
- Enterprise accounts (long cycles)
- C-level executives (very busy)
- Strategic accounts (relationship-building)

**Risk**: May lose hot leads (too slow)

---

## Timezone Considerations

### Prospect in Different Timezone

**Rule**: Always send emails at 10am **in prospect's local timezone**, not yours

**Example**:
- You're in San Francisco (PST)
- Prospect is in New York (EST, +3 hours)
- Send email at 7am PST = 10am EST (prospect's time)

**Tools**:
- Email scheduling tools (HubSpot, Outreach, SalesLoft) support timezone sending
- Google Calendar "Find a time" shows recipient timezone

### International Prospects

**US → Europe** (6-9 hours ahead):
- Send emails in evening (your time) = morning (their time)
- Example: 8pm PST = 5am CET (too early), send at 1am PST = 10am CET

**US → Asia** (12-16 hours ahead):
- Send emails late night (your time) = next day morning (their time)
- Example: 6pm PST = 11am JST (next day)

**Europe → US** (6-9 hours behind):
- Send emails early morning (your time) = previous day evening (their time)
- Better: Schedule for their morning (your afternoon)

**Recommendation**: Use email scheduling tools to hit 10am local time

## Sequence Timing Quality Checklist

**Before finalizing sequence timing, verify**:
- [ ] Day 0 is Tuesday or Wednesday (best days)
- [ ] Day 0 time is 10am local (prospect timezone)
- [ ] Follow-ups use same day-of-week pattern (consistency)
- [ ] Phone call is on Tuesday-Thursday (avoid Mon/Fri)
- [ ] Phone call time is 8-9am or 5-6pm (off-hours)
- [ ] Break-up email is Day 14 or later (professional patience)
- [ ] Industry seasonality checked (avoid busy seasons)
- [ ] Persona timing adjusted (Founder = faster, CFO = slower)
- [ ] Total duration matches sequence type (14-30 days)

**Red flags**:
- Day 0 on Monday or Friday (worst days)
- Email sent at 7pm (too late, feels desperate)
- Phone call on Friday afternoon (low answer rate)
- Break-up email before Day 14 (too impatient)
- No consideration of prospect timezone (bad experience)
