# Channel Mix Strategy

## Overview

When and how to use email, phone, and LinkedIn in multi-touch outreach sequences for maximum effectiveness.

## Channel Comparison

### Email

**Strengths**:
- Scalable (send to 100+ prospects easily)
- Prospect controls timing (read when convenient)
- Measurable (open rates, reply rates, link clicks)
- Permanent record (easy to reference)
- Low pressure (prospect doesn't feel put on spot)

**Weaknesses**:
- Easy to ignore (delete, mark spam)
- Low response rate (8-12% for cold outreach)
- Crowded channel (average person gets 120+ emails/day)
- No tone of voice (can be misinterpreted)

**Best for**:
- Initial outreach (Day 0)
- Follow-ups (Day 3, 7, 14)
- Providing resources (case studies, links)
- Scaling to large lists (100+ prospects)

**Response rate**: 8-12% (cold), 15-25% (warm)

### Phone

**Strengths**:
- High quality (real-time conversation)
- Cuts through noise (hard to ignore ringing phone)
- Rapport building (voice, tone, personality)
- Immediate qualification (can ask questions, get answers)
- Decision-maker respect (Pete Kazanjy: "Execs respect the phone")

**Weaknesses**:
- Low answer rate (5-10% cold calling)
- Not scalable (20 calls/hour max)
- Gatekeeper challenges (admin screens calls)
- Prospect feels pressure (put on spot)
- Time-consuming (15-30 min per conversation)

**Best for**:
- Mid-sequence (Day 10, after 3 emails)
- High-value targets (worth the time investment)
- Qualification (ask questions, assess fit)
- Breaking through email silence (no email response by Day 10)

**Answer rate**: 5-10% (cold), 15-25% (warm, expecting call)

### LinkedIn

**Strengths**:
- Professional context (not intrusive like email/phone)
- Profile visibility (prospect can research you first)
- Social proof (mutual connections, shared groups)
- Low barrier (connection request = soft touch)
- Supplementary channel (adds to email, doesn't replace)

**Weaknesses**:
- Low response rate (5-8% for cold InMail)
- Limited scale (LinkedIn limits InMail credits)
- Requires prospect to be active on LinkedIn (not everyone is)
- Slower response (may not check LinkedIn daily)
- Easy to ignore (notification fatigue)

**Best for**:
- Supplementary touch (in addition to email, not replacement)
- Profile viewing (creates notification, no message needed)
- Connection requests (Day 0 or Day 7)
- InMail (if no email response by Day 7)

**Response rate**: 5-8% (InMail), 20-30% (connection acceptance)

## Channel Mix by Sequence Stage

### Day 0: Initial Outreach

**Primary channel**: Email
**Supplementary**: LinkedIn profile view (optional)

**Email**:
- Subject: Problem hook (e.g., "20% return rates killing margins?")
- Body: 4 sentences max (problem, solution, ask)
- Goal: Get response or permission to continue

**LinkedIn profile view** (optional):
- Visit prospect's LinkedIn profile
- Creates notification: "{Your Name} viewed your profile"
- Goal: Multi-touch (email + social presence)
- Do NOT send connection request yet (too aggressive on Day 0)

**Why not phone on Day 0**:
- Too aggressive (prospect doesn't know you yet)
- No context (haven't seen your emails)
- Low answer rate (they don't recognize your number)

**Why not LinkedIn message on Day 0**:
- Combined with email = too much (overwhelming)
- Save LinkedIn for later (if email doesn't work)

### Day 3: Follow-up #1

**Primary channel**: Email
**Supplementary**: None (keep it simple)

**Email**:
- Subject: Reply to Day 0 thread (Re: original subject)
- Body: Add value (case study, insight, stat)
- Goal: Remind of Day 0, provide additional value

**Why not phone on Day 3**:
- Too soon (give email a chance)
- Only 3 days since initial (be patient)

**Why not LinkedIn on Day 3**:
- Save for Day 7 (spacing out channels)
- Don't want to spam across channels

### Day 7: Follow-up #2

**Primary channel**: Email
**Supplementary**: LinkedIn connection request (recommended)

**Email**:
- Subject: New thread (different angle, not reply)
- Body: Different problem angle (alternative pain point)
- Goal: Approach from different direction (first angle may not have resonated)

**LinkedIn connection request**:
- Send connection request with note
- Note: "Hi {FirstName}, I've reached out via email about {problem} for {industry} companies. Would love to connect and share insights from similar companies."
- Goal: Build relationship, create multiple touchpoints
- Timing: Day 7 = after 2 emails, not too aggressive

**Why add LinkedIn on Day 7**:
- 2 emails sent, prospect has seen your name twice
- Connection request feels less random (they've seen your emails)
- Multi-channel = more visibility

**Why not phone on Day 7**:
- Still too early (give email more time)
- Phone is for Day 10 (after 3 emails)

### Day 10: Phone Call

**Primary channel**: Phone
**Supplementary**: Email (if voicemail, send follow-up email)

**Phone call**:
- Call company main line or direct line (if found)
- Script: Reference email sequence ("I've sent you a few emails about...")
- Goal: Live conversation, qualify fit, schedule demo
- Timing: Tuesday-Thursday, 8-9am or 5-6pm (off-hours)

**Voicemail** (if no answer):
- Script: "Hi {FirstName}, {Your Name} from {Company}. I've sent you a few emails about {problem} for {industry} brands. We've helped companies like {CaseStudy} reduce {problem} by 35%. Feel free to reach me at {YourPhone} or reply to my emails. Thanks!"
- Keep under 30 seconds
- Reference email sequence (establishes continuity)

**Follow-up email** (after phone call/voicemail):
- Send within 1 hour of call
- Subject: "Just tried to reach you"
- Body: "Hi {FirstName}, just left you a voicemail about {problem}. If email is easier, happy to continue the conversation here. Quick 15-min call to share what we're seeing?"

**Why phone on Day 10**:
- 3 emails sent (prospect has had chance to respond via email)
- If no email response, phone cuts through noise
- Pete Kazanjy: "The phone is not dead - salespeople who don't call are dead"

**Why email after phone call**:
- Multi-touch (voicemail + email = 2 touches in 1 day)
- Prospect can respond via email if they prefer (easier than calling back)
- Reinforces continuity (you're persistent but respectful)

### Day 14: Break-up Email

**Primary channel**: Email
**Supplementary**: None (keep it clean)

**Email**:
- Subject: "Should I close your file?"
- Body: Permission-based close (easy out or easy in)
- Goal: Elicit response or remove from sequence
- Tone: Respectful, not guilt-trippy

**Why email only on Day 14**:
- Break-up is soft close (not hard sell)
- Prospect needs space to respond (phone feels pushy)
- Email gives them easy out (reply "not interested")

**Why not phone on Day 14**:
- Already called on Day 10 (don't overdo phone)
- Break-up on phone feels awkward (pressure)
- Email is lower pressure (better for break-up)

**Why not LinkedIn on Day 14**:
- Break-up is email-only (clean channel)
- LinkedIn message for break-up feels weird (too social)

### Day 21: Final Touch

**Primary channel**: Email
**Supplementary**: None

**Email**:
- Condition: Only if relevant case study or proof point available
- Subject: "{CaseStudy} reduced {problem} by 40%"
- Body: Pure value delivery (no ask, just share success story)
- Goal: Final touch, leave door open

**Why email only on Day 21**:
- Final touch is value-only (not sales pitch)
- No other channels needed (they've seen everything)

## Channel Selection by Persona

### Founder / CEO (Small Companies)

**Best channels**: Phone + Email (they answer the phone!)

**Recommended pattern**:
- Day 0: Email
- Day 3: Phone (earlier call, they're accessible)
- Day 7: Email + LinkedIn connection
- Day 14: Email (break-up)

**Why phone early**:
- Founders answer their own phone (no gatekeeper)
- Small companies = fast decision cycles (get on phone quickly)
- Founders respect directness (appreciate the call)

**Why less email**:
- Founders are busy (fewer emails = better)
- Phone is more efficient for them (quick qualification)

### CFO / Finance

**Best channels**: Email-heavy (they're analytical, prefer written)

**Recommended pattern**:
- Day 0: Email
- Day 3: Email (case study with ROI data)
- Day 7: Email (different angle, cost savings)
- Day 10: Email (not phone - they hate sales calls)
- Day 14: Phone (if no email response, finally try phone)
- Day 21: Email (break-up)

**Why email-heavy**:
- CFOs are analytical (want to review materials before talking)
- Hate surprise calls (prefer scheduled calls)
- Want data first (ROI, case studies, pricing)

**Why late phone call**:
- Only call if email hasn't worked (phone is last resort)
- CFOs respect persistence but hate pushiness

### CMO / Marketing

**Best channels**: Email + LinkedIn (they live on both)

**Recommended pattern**:
- Day 0: Email + LinkedIn profile view
- Day 3: Email
- Day 7: LinkedIn connection request + Email
- Day 10: LinkedIn InMail (if connection not accepted)
- Day 14: Phone + Email
- Day 21: Email (break-up)

**Why LinkedIn-heavy**:
- CMOs are active on LinkedIn (post, engage, research)
- Appreciate multi-channel (it's their world)
- Social proof matters (mutual connections, shared content)

**Why phone later**:
- Email + LinkedIn first (their preferred channels)
- Phone if other channels fail (but CMOs do take calls)

### CTO / Technical

**Best channels**: Email-only (until they respond)

**Recommended pattern**:
- Day 0: Email (technical content, not sales pitch)
- Day 5: Email (architecture, integration details)
- Day 10: Email (security, compliance info)
- Day 15: Phone (only if no email response)
- Day 21: Email (break-up)

**Why email-only**:
- CTOs HATE sales calls (waste of time)
- Want technical details first (email is better for this)
- Will respond when ready (don't push)

**Why very late phone call**:
- Only call if email hasn't worked (phone is last resort)
- If you do call, offer technical demo (not business pitch)

### VP / Director-Level

**Best channels**: Balanced (email + phone + LinkedIn)

**Recommended pattern**:
- Day 0: Email
- Day 3: Email
- Day 7: Email + LinkedIn connection
- Day 10: Phone + Email (voicemail follow-up)
- Day 14: Email (break-up)

**Why balanced**:
- VPs/Directors are primary B2B buyers (standard approach works)
- Appreciate multi-channel (shows effort)
- Take phone calls (not too busy like C-level, not too junior)

## Channel Effectiveness by Company Size

### Small (1-50 employees)

**Most effective channel**: Phone (decision-makers answer directly)

**Channel mix**:
- Email: 60% of touches (still needed for context)
- Phone: 30% of touches (high answer rate, worth the effort)
- LinkedIn: 10% of touches (supplementary)

**Rationale**:
- Small companies = no gatekeepers (phone gets through)
- Founders/owners answer their own phone (accessible)
- Fast decision cycles (phone accelerates sales)

### Medium (50-200 employees)

**Most effective channel**: Email (scalable, professional)

**Channel mix**:
- Email: 70% of touches (primary channel)
- Phone: 20% of touches (mid-sequence phone call)
- LinkedIn: 10% of touches (supplementary)

**Rationale**:
- Mid-size companies = some gatekeepers (phone harder)
- Decision-makers are VPs/Directors (prefer email first)
- Standard sales cycles (email-first approach works)

### Large (200+ employees)

**Most effective channel**: Email + LinkedIn (phone very difficult)

**Channel mix**:
- Email: 60% of touches (primary)
- LinkedIn: 30% of touches (easier to reach execs than phone)
- Phone: 10% of touches (very low answer rate, last resort)

**Rationale**:
- Large companies = strong gatekeepers (phone almost impossible)
- Decision-makers are VPs/SVPs (very busy, don't answer phone)
- Long sales cycles (relationship-building via LinkedIn)

## Channel Switching Strategy

### If Email Not Working (No Opens by Day 7)

**Problem**: Emails not being opened

**Possible causes**:
- Wrong email address (bounce)
- Spam filter (never reaching inbox)
- Subject line not compelling (deleted without opening)

**Solution**:
1. Verify email address (check for bounce)
2. Try different subject line (Day 7 email)
3. Try LinkedIn InMail (Day 10 instead of phone)
4. Try phone (Day 14 - company main line, ask for person)

### If Email Opening But Not Responding (Opens, No Reply)

**Problem**: Prospect opens emails but doesn't reply

**Possible causes**:
- Content not compelling (not interested)
- Timing wrong (not a priority now)
- Wants to research before replying (needs time)

**Solution**:
1. Change content angle (Day 7 - different problem)
2. Add value without ask (Day 10 - share case study, no ask)
3. Try phone (Day 14 - "I see you've seen my emails, wanted to connect by phone")
4. Break-up email (Day 21 - "Should I close your file?")

### If Phone Not Connecting (Voicemail, No Callback)

**Problem**: Calls go to voicemail, no callback

**Possible causes**:
- Wrong number (company main line, not direct)
- Don't recognize your number (screening calls)
- Voicemail not compelling (deleted without listening)

**Solution**:
1. Call at different time (8am or 5:30pm - off-hours)
2. Send email immediately after voicemail (multi-touch)
3. Try LinkedIn message (Day 14 - "I've tried to reach you by phone and email...")
4. Give up on phone (focus on email + LinkedIn)

### If LinkedIn Connection Not Accepted

**Problem**: Connection request ignored or rejected

**Possible causes**:
- Not active on LinkedIn (doesn't check regularly)
- Connection note not compelling (generic request)
- Too many connection requests (selective about accepting)

**Solution**:
1. Don't take it personally (not everyone uses LinkedIn)
2. Try LinkedIn InMail instead (doesn't require connection)
3. Focus on email + phone (LinkedIn not working for this prospect)

---

## Multi-Channel Coordination

### Same-Day Multi-Touch (Recommended)

**Day 10 example**:
- 8:00am: Call company phone (leave voicemail if no answer)
- 9:00am: Send follow-up email ("Just tried to reach you...")
- Result: 2 touches in 1 hour (voicemail + email)

**Rationale**: Multi-touch increases response rate (prospect sees your name twice)

### Same-Day Multi-Touch (Not Recommended)

**Day 0 example**:
- 10:00am: Send email
- 11:00am: Send LinkedIn InMail
- 3:00pm: Call phone
- Result: 3 touches in 5 hours (OVERWHELMING)

**Rationale**: Too aggressive, feels spammy, overwhelming for prospect

**Rule**: Max 2 touches per day (and only if one is phone voicemail + follow-up email)

### Spacing Between Channels

**LinkedIn connection request timing**:
- If sent on Day 0 with email: Too much (2 touches in 1 day)
- If sent on Day 7 after 2 emails: Good (spacing between channels)

**Phone call timing**:
- If called on Day 3 after 1 email: Too early (give email a chance)
- If called on Day 10 after 3 emails: Good (email had chance, now try phone)

**Rule**: Space different channels by at least 3-4 days

---

## Channel Priority by Goal

### Goal: Maximize Scale (100+ prospects)

**Channel priority**:
1. Email (90% of effort)
2. LinkedIn profile views (10% of effort)
3. Phone (0% - not scalable)

**Rationale**: Email is only scalable channel (can send 100+ per day)

### Goal: Maximize Quality (10-20 high-value prospects)

**Channel priority**:
1. Phone (40% of effort)
2. Email (40% of effort)
3. LinkedIn (20% of effort)

**Rationale**: Phone yields highest quality conversations (worth the time for high-value targets)

### Goal: Build Relationship (Strategic accounts)

**Channel priority**:
1. LinkedIn (50% of effort - connection, engagement, InMail)
2. Email (30% of effort - value-driven, not sales-y)
3. Phone (20% of effort - scheduled calls, not cold calls)

**Rationale**: LinkedIn is best for relationship-building (social proof, shared connections, content engagement)

## Channel Mix Quality Checklist

**Before finalizing channel mix, verify**:
- [ ] Email is primary channel (most scalable)
- [ ] Phone call on Day 10+ (after 3 emails, not earlier)
- [ ] LinkedIn is supplementary (not replacement for email)
- [ ] Max 2 touches per day (voicemail + email only)
- [ ] Channels spaced 3-4 days apart (not all on same day)
- [ ] Channel mix matches persona (Founder = more phone, CTO = less phone)
- [ ] Channel mix matches company size (Small = more phone, Large = less phone)
- [ ] Break-up email is email-only (no phone/LinkedIn)

**Red flags**:
- Phone call on Day 0-3 (too early)
- 3+ channels on same day (overwhelming)
- Phone-only (not scalable)
- LinkedIn-only (low response rate)
- No phone call at all (missing critical channel per Pete Kazanjy)
