# Objection Handling Patterns

## Overview

Common B2B SaaS objections and response frameworks for discovery, demo, and closing stages. Based on consultative selling principles: understand before responding, don't argue, provide value.

## Objection Response Frameworks

### Framework 1: Feel-Felt-Found

**Structure**:
1. **Feel**: Empathize with their concern
2. **Felt**: Share that others had same concern
3. **Found**: Show what they discovered

**When to use**: General objections (price, timing, uncertainty)

**Example**:
```
Objection: "This seems expensive"

Response:
"I totally understand how you feel. Other companies we work with felt the same way initially. What they found was that when they looked at the cost of the problem - in your case $400K/year in returns - the investment of $5K/month actually delivered a 7x ROI. Does that perspective help?"
```

### Framework 2: LAER (Listen, Acknowledge, Explore, Respond)

**Structure**:
1. **Listen**: Let them fully explain concern
2. **Acknowledge**: Validate their concern (don't dismiss)
3. **Explore**: Ask clarifying questions
4. **Respond**: Address root cause

**When to use**: Complex objections that need understanding

**Example**:
```
Objection: "We need to think about it"

Response:
Listen: [Let them explain why]
Acknowledge: "That's completely reasonable. This is an important decision."
Explore: "Can I ask - what specifically would you need to think through? Is it budget, getting stakeholders aligned, or understanding the solution better?"
Respond: [Based on their answer, address specific concern]
```

### Framework 3: Isolate and Confirm

**Structure**:
1. **Isolate**: Identify if this is THE objection or one of many
2. **Confirm**: If this were resolved, would they move forward?
3. **Address**: Focus on solving the isolated objection

**When to use**: When you suspect there's a hidden objection

**Example**:
```
Objection: "The price is too high"

Response:
Isolate: "I understand. If we could find a way to make the price work, is there anything else that would prevent you from moving forward?"
Confirm: [If they say no] "So if we can address the price concern, you'd be ready to proceed?"
Address: [Now focus on price: ROI, payment plans, etc.]
```

### Framework 4: Reframe

**Structure**:
1. **Acknowledge** concern
2. **Reframe** from different perspective
3. **Provide evidence** for reframe

**When to use**: When objection is based on incorrect assumption

**Example**:
```
Objection: "This seems complicated to implement"

Response:
Acknowledge: "I can see why you might think that."
Reframe: "What we've found is that the implementation is actually one of the simplest parts. It's a plugin that installs in 15 minutes, and we guide you through the whole setup."
Evidence: "Our average customer goes live in under a week, and our G2 reviews consistently mention 'easy implementation' as a strength."
```

---

## Objection Category 1: Price Objections

### Objection: "This is too expensive"

**Root cause**: They don't see value justifying cost

**Response framework**: Reframe to ROI

**Response**:
```
"I understand price is a concern. Let's look at the math together. You mentioned you're experiencing $400K/year in returns. Our solution costs $60K/year and typically reduces returns by 35%. That's a $140K savings, or 2.3x ROI in year one. When you look at it that way, does the investment make sense?"
```

**Follow-up questions**:
- "What ROI would you need to see to justify this?"
- "What's the cost of not solving this problem?"
- "What would make this a no-brainer?"

**If they persist**:
- Explore payment plans: "Would quarterly payments help?"
- Explore scaled approach: "What if we started with a pilot?"
- Explore budget: "When does your budget cycle refresh?"

### Objection: "We don't have budget for this"

**Root cause**: Either truly no budget, or not a priority

**Response framework**: Explore (is it dollars or priority?)

**Response**:
```
"I understand. Can I ask - is it that there's no budget available anywhere, or that you'd need to reallocate budget from somewhere else?"

[If truly no budget]
"When does your budget cycle refresh? Let's plan to reconnect then and I can help you build the business case."

[If need to reallocate]
"Given that this problem is costing $400K/year, would it make sense to pull budget from a lower-ROI initiative?"
```

**Follow-up questions**:
- "What would it take to secure budget?"
- "If we could show the ROI to your CFO, would that help?"
- "Is this a priority problem to solve?"

### Objection: "What's your cheapest option?"

**Root cause**: Price-shopping, not value-focused

**Response framework**: Redirect to value

**Response**:
```
"I appreciate you being mindful of cost. Before we talk about pricing, let me ask - what's the cost of this problem to your business? [Listen] Okay, so if we can solve a $400K/year problem, the question isn't what's the cheapest option, it's what's the best ROI. Make sense?"
```

**Follow-up questions**:
- "What other criteria besides price are important?"
- "Have you bought tools based on lowest price before? How did that work out?"
- "If we could show this pays for itself in 3 months, would price still be the main concern?"

### Objection: "We can build this ourselves"

**Root cause**: Technical team thinks it's easy, or want to own solution

**Response framework**: Acknowledge, explore opportunity cost

**Response**:
```
"That's great that you have the technical capability. I'm curious - what's your engineering team's backlog looking like? [Listen] So if they built this instead of {other priority}, what's the trade-off? Also, how long would it take them? [Listen] Most companies underestimate by 3-5x. Our solution is ready today, and includes {benefits they'd have to build}."
```

**Follow-up questions**:
- "What's your team's hourly cost? What's the total cost of build?"
- "Who would maintain this once built?"
- "What happens if the engineer who built it leaves?"
- "Is this your core competency or a distraction?"

---

## Objection Category 2: Timing Objections

### Objection: "We need to think about it"

**Root cause**: Unclear concern, need time, or polite brush-off

**Response framework**: LAER (explore what they need to think about)

**Response**:
```
"Absolutely, this is an important decision. Can I ask - what specifically would you need to think through? Is it budget, getting other stakeholders involved, understanding the solution better, or something else?"

[Listen to their answer, then address specific concern]

"What would make this a clear 'yes' for you?"
```

**Follow-up questions**:
- "What information are you missing to make a decision?"
- "When would you be ready to decide?"
- "What's the risk of deciding vs not deciding?"

### Objection: "This isn't a priority right now"

**Root cause**: Other initiatives more urgent, or problem isn't painful enough

**Response framework**: Create urgency via consequence

**Response**:
```
"I understand you have a lot on your plate. Can I ask - what would need to change for this to become a priority? [Listen] You mentioned the problem is costing $400K/year - that's $33K/month you're losing while this sits on the back burner. What's the cost of waiting 3-6 months?"
```

**Follow-up questions**:
- "If you could solve this with minimal effort, would it be a priority?"
- "What are your top 3 priorities? How does this problem compare?"
- "Is there an upcoming event (holiday season, funding, etc.) that would make this urgent?"

**If they persist**:
```
"Fair enough. Let's stay in touch. When should I check back in? 3 months? 6 months?"
```

### Objection: "Let's revisit this next quarter/year"

**Root cause**: Delaying decision, not urgent enough

**Response framework**: Isolate (is it timing or something else?)

**Response**:
```
"I understand. Can I ask - is it that next quarter is genuinely better timing, or is there another concern we should address? [Listen]

[If genuinely timing]
"What's happening next quarter that makes it better timing?"

[If another concern]
"It sounds like timing isn't the real issue. What is?"
```

**Follow-up questions**:
- "What happens to the problem between now and next quarter?"
- "If we could start with a pilot now, would that help?"
- "What's the cost of waiting?"

### Objection: "We're too busy right now to implement this"

**Root cause**: Resource constraint, or not painful enough to prioritize

**Response framework**: Explore implementation effort vs problem cost

**Response**:
```
"I hear you. Implementation is actually much simpler than most people expect - it's a 15-minute plugin install and we handle the setup with you. The question is: are you too busy to save $33K/month? Because that's what waiting costs you."
```

**Follow-up questions**:
- "What would it take to carve out 2 hours for setup?"
- "If we could do 90% of the work for you, would that help?"
- "How long will you be 'too busy'?"

---

## Objection Category 3: Product/Solution Objections

### Objection: "We already have a solution for this"

**Root cause**: Using competitor or internal solution

**Response framework**: Differentiate (don't bash)

**Response**:
```
"That's great you're addressing this problem. I'm curious - what solution are you using? [Listen] How's that working for you? [Listen]

[Listen for gaps, then]

"How does your current solution handle {specific gap they mentioned or implied}? We've found that {our differentiator} is what makes the difference for companies like yours."
```

**Follow-up questions**:
- "If you could improve one thing about your current solution, what would it be?"
- "What made you take this call if you already have a solution?" (often reveals gaps)
- "Are you 100% satisfied, or is there room for improvement?"

**If they're happy with current solution**:
```
"That's awesome. Sounds like you're in a good place. If anything changes or you want to see how we're different, I'm here. Can I check back in 6 months?"
```

### Objection: "We don't think this will work for us"

**Root cause**: Unclear, or they don't see fit

**Response framework**: Explore specific concern

**Response**:
```
"Can you help me understand what makes you feel that way? [Listen]

[Address specific concern]

"Have you seen other companies like yours successfully use solutions like this?"
```

**Follow-up questions**:
- "What would need to be true for this to work for you?"
- "Is it the solution itself, or something about your situation?"
- "What would success look like for you?"

### Objection: "We need feature X that you don't have"

**Root cause**: Feature gap, may or may not be deal-breaker

**Response framework**: Isolate (is this THE issue?)

**Response**:
```
"Thanks for being upfront about that. Can I ask - if we had feature X, is there anything else that would prevent you from moving forward? [Isolate]

[If feature X is THE issue]
"How critical is feature X? We've found that most companies prioritize {core benefit} over feature X. Would you be open to starting with our core features and we can explore adding X to the roadmap?"

[If feature X is not THE issue]
"It sounds like feature X isn't the real blocker. What is?"
```

**Follow-up questions**:
- "What would you lose by not having feature X?"
- "Are you willing to wait for feature X, or do you need it now?"
- "What if we built feature X for you as a custom add-on?"

### Objection: "This seems complicated"

**Root cause**: Implementation concern, or solution seems complex

**Response framework**: Reframe with evidence

**Response**:
```
"I can understand why it might seem that way. The reality is that our customers consistently rate us 4.8/5 on 'ease of use' and 'easy implementation'. Here's how it works: [simple explanation]. Does that clear it up?"
```

**Follow-up questions**:
- "What specifically seems complicated?"
- "Have you implemented similar tools before? How did it go?"
- "Would a hands-on demo help clarify?"

---

## Objection Category 4: Authority/Process Objections

### Objection: "I need to run this by my boss/team"

**Root cause**: Lacks authority, or needs buy-in

**Response framework**: Offer to present directly

**Response**:
```
"That makes total sense. Who else needs to be involved in this decision? [Listen]

"Would it be helpful if I presented to your team/boss directly? I can walk through the ROI and answer any questions. That way you don't have to become the expert on our solution."
```

**Follow-up questions**:
- "What concerns do you think they'll have?"
- "What information would they need to see to approve this?"
- "When could we get them on a call?"

### Objection: "We need to evaluate other options first"

**Root cause**: Want to compare (legitimate), or delaying

**Response framework**: Acknowledge, offer to help with evaluation

**Response**:
```
"Absolutely, you should evaluate all your options. Out of curiosity, what other solutions are you looking at? [Listen]

"I'm happy to provide an evaluation framework to help you compare apples to apples. Most companies look at: ROI, implementation time, feature fit, support quality. Does that help?"
```

**Follow-up questions**:
- "What criteria are most important in your evaluation?"
- "What's your timeline for deciding?"
- "Can I follow up after you've completed your evaluation?"

**If they persist**:
```
"Fair enough. When should I check back in? 2 weeks? 30 days?"
```

### Objection: "We need to go through procurement/legal"

**Root cause**: Real process, but may be delaying tactic

**Response framework**: Offer to help with process

**Response**:
```
"Absolutely, we work with procurement/legal teams all the time. What's your typical process look like? [Listen]

"We have a standard contract template, security documentation, and compliance certifications that usually satisfy most procurement/legal requirements. Would it help if I sent those over to get the ball rolling?"
```

**Follow-up questions**:
- "How long does procurement/legal typically take?"
- "What can we do to expedite the process?"
- "Are there any red flags in our solution that would hold up procurement/legal?"

### Objection: "We're working with another vendor on this"

**Root cause**: They're in late-stage talks with competitor

**Response framework**: Isolate (are they decided, or still evaluating?)

**Response**:
```
"Thanks for being transparent. Can I ask - are you 100% decided on that vendor, or still evaluating? [Listen]

[If still evaluating]
"What would it take for us to be considered alongside them?"

[If decided]
"Fair enough. If things don't work out with that vendor, I'd love to be your backup option. Can I check in 3-6 months?"
```

**Follow-up questions**:
- "What made you choose that vendor?"
- "How far along are you in the process?"
- "Is there anything they're not providing that we could help with?"

---

## Objection Category 5: Trust/Risk Objections

### Objection: "We've been burned by solutions like this before"

**Root cause**: Past bad experience, skepticism

**Response framework**: Feel-Felt-Found + Social Proof

**Response**:
```
"I totally understand, and I appreciate you sharing that. What happened? [Listen]

"Other companies have felt the same way after bad experiences. What they found with us was that {address their specific bad experience}. For example, {customer story similar to their situation}.

Would it help to talk to one of our customers who had a similar concern?"
```

**Follow-up questions**:
- "What would need to be true this time for you to feel confident?"
- "What safeguards would make you comfortable?"
- "Would a pilot or trial period help derisk this?"

### Objection: "You're too small/new/unknown"

**Root cause**: Risk aversion, want established vendor

**Response framework**: Reframe (small = advantage)

**Response**:
```
"I understand wanting to work with an established vendor. A couple things: first, we have {X customers} including {notable customers} who chose us specifically because {advantage of being smaller: responsiveness, customization, innovation}.

Second, the question isn't how big we are, it's whether we can solve your problem. Based on what you've shared, we're a perfect fit for {their situation}. Does that make sense?"
```

**Follow-up questions**:
- "What's your concern about our size specifically?"
- "Would talking to our existing customers help?"
- "What would make you comfortable with us?"

### Objection: "What if you go out of business?"

**Root cause**: Vendor risk concern

**Response framework**: Provide evidence of stability

**Response**:
```
"That's a fair question. We're {funded by X, profitable, X years in business, X% year-over-year growth}. We have {X customers} and {$X in ARR/revenue}. We're not going anywhere.

That said, our contracts include {data portability, source code escrow, 90-day notice}. You're protected even in the unlikely event something happened. Does that address your concern?"
```

**Follow-up questions**:
- "What specifically concerns you about our stability?"
- "What safeguards would make you comfortable?"
- "Would talking to our investors/board help?"

### Objection: "We need to see a case study from our exact industry"

**Root cause**: Want proof it works for their specific situation

**Response framework**: Bridge with similar examples

**Response**:
```
"I understand wanting to see proof. We have {case study from adjacent industry} which is similar to yours in that {similarity}. The results were {results}.

That said, the underlying problem - {their problem} - is the same across industries. Would you be open to a pilot to prove it works for you specifically?"
```

**Follow-up questions**:
- "What about your industry makes it unique?"
- "If we could deliver results in a pilot, would that be sufficient proof?"
- "What would make you comfortable moving forward without a same-industry case study?"

## Advanced Objection Techniques

### Technique 1: Pre-Empting Objections

**When**: When you know an objection is coming (price, complexity, etc.)

**How**: Address before they bring it up

**Example**:
```
"Before we go further, I should mention that our solution is a premium option. It costs $60K/year. For some companies that's too expensive, but for companies with your problem size - $400K/year in returns - it's actually a 2.3x ROI. Does that make sense to explore further?"
```

**Benefit**: You control the narrative and frame the objection

### Technique 2: Boomerang

**When**: Objection can be reframed as a reason to buy

**How**: Turn objection into benefit

**Example**:
```
Objection: "We're in our busy season"
Boomerang: "That's exactly why this is the perfect time. Your busy season is when the problem costs you the most. If we implement now, you'll save $50K this quarter vs waiting until after busy season."
```

### Technique 3: Question the Objection

**When**: Objection doesn't make sense or seems like a brush-off

**How**: Politely challenge with a question

**Example**:
```
Objection: "We're happy with our current situation"
Question: "I'm curious - if you're completely happy, why did you take this call? Often when companies say that, there's something they'd improve if they could. What would that be for you?"
```

### Technique 4: Trial Close After Objection

**When**: After successfully addressing an objection

**How**: Ask for commitment to next step

**Example**:
```
[After addressing price objection with ROI]
"Does that address your concern about price? Great. So if we can show you this ROI in a demo, are you ready to move forward?"
```

## Objection Handling Best Practices

**Do**:
- ✓ **Listen fully** before responding (don't interrupt)
- ✓ **Acknowledge** their concern (validate, don't dismiss)
- ✓ **Ask clarifying questions** (understand root cause)
- ✓ **Address root cause**, not surface objection
- ✓ **Use customer stories** (social proof works)
- ✓ **Trial close** after handling objection (confirm it's resolved)

**Don't**:
- ✗ **Argue** or get defensive (you lose rapport)
- ✗ **Dismiss** their concern ("That's not a real issue")
- ✗ **Assume** you know the reason (ask, don't guess)
- ✗ **Over-explain** (keep responses concise)
- ✗ **Bash competitors** (stay professional)
- ✗ **Give up** after first objection (it's part of the process)

## Common Objection Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Responding Too Quickly

**What it looks like**:
```
Prospect: "This seems expensive"
Salesperson: [Immediately] "But look at the ROI..." [launches into pitch]
```

**Why it's wrong**: You haven't understood their real concern

**Better approach**:
```
Prospect: "This seems expensive"
Salesperson: "I understand. Can you help me understand - expensive compared to what? The cost of the problem, or your budget, or other solutions?"
[Listen, then respond to THEIR specific concern]
```

### Mistake 2: Getting Defensive

**What it looks like**:
```
Prospect: "Your competitor has feature X"
Salesperson: "Well, they don't have features Y and Z like we do!" [defensive]
```

**Why it's wrong**: Sounds insecure, prospect loses trust

**Better approach**:
```
Prospect: "Your competitor has feature X"
Salesperson: "That's true, they do. How critical is feature X for you? [Listen] We've found that most companies prioritize {our strength} over feature X. Let me show you..."
```

### Mistake 3: Accepting Objection at Face Value

**What it looks like**:
```
Prospect: "We need to think about it"
Salesperson: "Okay, I'll follow up next week" [accepts at face value]
```

**Why it's wrong**: "Need to think about it" is rarely the real objection

**Better approach**:
```
Prospect: "We need to think about it"
Salesperson: "Of course. Can I ask - what specifically would you need to think through? Budget, stakeholders, solution fit?" [Explore real objection]
```

### Mistake 4: Offering Discounts Too Quickly

**What it looks like**:
```
Prospect: "This is expensive"
Salesperson: "I can offer you 20% off" [immediate discount]
```

**Why it's wrong**: Destroys perceived value, trains them to negotiate

**Better approach**:
```
Prospect: "This is expensive"
Salesperson: "Let's look at the ROI first. [Show ROI] When you see those numbers, does the investment make sense?" [Only discount if ROI isn't compelling]
```

**Timing Objections**:
- "Need to think" → LAER (explore concern)
- "Not a priority" → Create urgency
- "Next quarter" → Isolate (timing or something else?)
- "Too busy" → Implementation effort vs cost

**Product Objections**:
- "Have solution" → Differentiate (find gaps)
- "Won't work" → Explore specific concern
