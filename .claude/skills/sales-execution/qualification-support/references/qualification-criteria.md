# Qualification Criteria Framework

## Overview

Pete Kazanjy's qualification framework for B2B SaaS sales, adapted with Problem Fit and Solution Fit dimensions for comprehensive lead qualification.

## The Five Qualification Dimensions

Traditional BANT (Budget, Authority, Need, Timing) has been enhanced to:
1. **Problem Fit** (replaces "Need" - more specific)
2. **Authority** (who can buy)
3. **Budget** (will they pay)
4. **Urgency** (replaces "Timing" - focuses on priority)
5. **Solution Fit** (should we sell to them)

---

## Dimension 1: Problem Fit (Weight: 0.3)

### Definition

**Do they have the problem we solve?**

The most important dimension (30% weight) because no problem = no sale, regardless of budget or authority.

### Key Questions

**Discovery questions**:
1. "Walk me through your current {process}" *(understand how they do things today)*
2. "What's working well with your current approach?" *(understand what not to disrupt)*
3. "What's not working well?" *(identify pain points)*
4. "What's your biggest challenge with {problem area}?" *(prioritize pain)*
5. "How often does this problem occur?" *(frequency)*
6. "What percentage of {metric} do you experience?" *(quantify problem)*
7. "How does this impact your business?" *(understand cost)*
8. "How does this impact your team?" *(understand operational burden)*
9. "What have you tried so far to solve this?" *(understand alternatives, urgency)*
10. "If you could wave a magic wand, what would you fix?" *(ideal outcome)*

### Scoring Rubric

**1.0 - Clear, quantified problem**:
- Problem matches our solution perfectly
- Quantified (e.g., "20-30% return rates")
- Cost understood (e.g., "costing $500K/year")
- Tried alternatives (urgency indicator)
- **Example**: "Our {key metric} is {X}%, mostly {root cause}-related. It's costing us ${cost}/year in {cost category}. We've tried {current approach} but they don't work well enough."

**0.7 - Problem exists but not quantified**:
- Problem confirmed but no specific metrics
- Cost not calculated
- Awareness exists
- **Example**: "{Problem area} is definitely high. We know it's a problem but haven't quantified exactly how much."

**0.5 - Problem exists but not prioritized**:
- Problem acknowledged but not a focus
- Other problems are higher priority
- No urgency to solve
- **Example**: "{Problem area} is a challenge, but we're managing. It's not our top priority right now."

**0.3 - Vague problem**:
- Problem is generic or unclear
- No specific pain point identified
- Exploring without clear need
- **Example**: "Things could always be better. We're looking at ways to improve operations generally."

**0.0 - No problem or already solved**:
- Don't see it as a problem
- Already have satisfactory solution
- Not relevant to their business
- **Example**: "Our {key metric} is 5%, which is industry-leading. We're really happy with where we are."

### Red Flags (Low Problem Fit)

**Warning signs**:
- Can't quantify problem ("I don't know our return rate")
- Can't articulate cost ("I'm not sure how much this costs us")
- Defensive about current process ("We're doing fine")
- Exploring without pain ("Just seeing what's out there")
- Someone else's problem ("My boss asked me to look into this")

**Action if red flags**: Score 0.5 or lower, likely disqualify unless other dimensions exceptionally strong

---

## Dimension 2: Authority (Weight: 0.2)

### Definition

**Can they make buying decisions?**

Critical dimension (20% weight) because selling to someone without authority wastes time.

### Key Questions

**Authority discovery questions**:
1. "What's your role in evaluating solutions like this?" *(gauge their position)*
2. "Who else would be involved in this decision?" *(identify stakeholders)*
3. "What's your typical process for bringing on new tools?" *(understand buying process)*
4. "Do you have budget authority for this?" *(direct question)*
5. "Who would ultimately sign off on this?" *(find economic buyer)*
6. "Have you made similar purchases before?" *(gauge experience)*
7. "What information would you need to make a decision?" *(decision criteria)*
8. "How long does your evaluation process typically take?" *(timeline)*
9. "Who owns the budget for {problem area}?" *(budget owner)*
10. "If you decided this was valuable, what would the approval process look like?" *(path to close)*

### Scoring Rubric

**1.0 - Decision-maker with budget authority**:
- Economic buyer (signs contracts)
- Has budget authority
- Can make decision without approval
- **Example**: "I'm the CMO, and I own the marketing budget. If this makes sense, I can approve it up to $100K."

**0.7 - Strong influencer, can champion**:
- Can recommend/champion solution
- Needs approval from one person (known)
- Has credibility with decision-maker
- **Example**: "I'm the Ecommerce Director. I'd evaluate this and recommend to our CFO if it looks good. She typically approves my recommendations."

**0.5 - Influencer, multiple stakeholders**:
- Part of evaluation team
- Multiple approvers needed
- Committee decision
- **Example**: "I'm on the evaluation committee with our CMO, CFO, and CTO. We'd all need to agree, then present to CEO for final approval."

**0.3 - Low influence, exploring only**:
- Junior person doing research
- Boss will make real decision
- Information gathering phase
- **Example**: "I'm doing initial research for my VP. If I find something interesting, I'll bring it to her."

**0.0 - No authority**:
- No decision-making power
- Not part of evaluation
- Consultant/intern/student
- **Example**: "I'm an intern researching options for a project I'm working on."

### Authority Persona Types

**Economic Buyer** (ideal):
- Signs contracts
- Controls budget
- Final decision authority
- **Titles**: CEO, CFO, CMO, VP (at smaller companies)

**Technical Buyer** (important):
- Evaluates solution
- Defines requirements
- Recommends solution
- **Titles**: Director, Head of, Manager (with domain expertise)

**End User** (valuable for influence):
- Will use the product
- Provides feedback
- Can champion or block
- **Titles**: Manager, Coordinator, Specialist

**Champion** (critical for complex sales):
- Internal advocate
- Sells on your behalf
- Navigates politics
- Can be any of above, but believes in solution

### Red Flags (Low Authority)

**Warning signs**:
- Can't answer "Who makes the decision?" ("I'm not sure")
- Junior title doing research ("I'm an analyst")
- Can't introduce you to decision-maker ("They're too busy")
- Long, unclear approval process ("It has to go through procurement, legal, finance, IT, and then the board")
- No skin in the game ("I'm just looking")

**Action if red flags**: Ask to include decision-maker on next call, or score 0.3 and deprioritize

---

## Dimension 3: Budget (Weight: 0.2)

### Definition

**Will they pay our price?**

Important dimension (20% weight) because even with problem and authority, no budget = no sale.

### Key Questions

**Budget discovery questions**:
1. "What's the cost of this problem currently?" *(quantify pain in dollars)*
2. "How much would solving this be worth to you?" *(value perception)*
3. "Have you allocated budget for solving this?" *(budget exists?)*
4. "What's your typical budget range for tools like this?" *(price expectations)*
5. "What ROI would you need to see to justify this?" *(decision criteria)*
6. "How do you typically evaluate ROI for new tools?" *(sophistication)*
7. "What other tools have you purchased recently in this price range?" *(precedent)*
8. "Is this a budgeted line item or would you need to find budget?" *(budget status)*
9. "What would prevent you from moving forward if the solution made sense?" *(barriers)*
10. "If we could show ${X} in savings/revenue, would that justify ${price}?" *(ROI threshold)*

### Scoring Rubric

**1.0 - Clear budget, can justify cost**:
- Budget allocated
- Problem cost quantified (high)
- ROI clear (3x+ preferred)
- **Example**: "We've allocated $100K for this. The problem costs us $500K/year, so if you can deliver 35% reduction, that's a 7x ROI. That works."

**0.7 - Budget exists but needs approval**:
- Budget allocated but needs business case
- ROI needs to be presented
- Approval process known
- **Example**: "We have budget in operations, but I'd need to present the ROI to our CFO for final approval. If the math works, it shouldn't be a problem."

**0.5 - Budget unclear, needs to build business case**:
- No specific budget allocated
- Would need to justify and secure budget
- Interested but needs to prove value
- **Example**: "I'd need to build a business case to secure budget. If we can show solid ROI, I can make it happen, but it will take a quarter."

**0.3 - Budget concern, price-sensitive**:
- Limited budget
- Price is a major concern
- Looking for cheapest option
- **Example**: "Budget is really tight. What's your absolute lowest price? We're looking at several options and cost is the main factor."

**0.0 - No budget or cost is insurmountable barrier**:
- No budget available
- Price is deal-breaker
- Can't afford any solution
- **Example**: "We're a bootstrapped startup and can't afford any new tools this year. We're just exploring for the future."

### Budget Best Practices

**Do**:
- ✓ Ask about problem cost before talking price (anchor on value, not cost)
- ✓ Frame in ROI terms ("$X/month investment for $Y/month savings")
- ✓ Ask about budget range early (don't waste time if wildly mismatched)
- ✓ Understand budget cycle (when does budget refresh?)
- ✓ Identify budget owner (may not be same person as economic buyer)

**Don't**:
- ✗ Lead with price (discuss value first)
- ✗ Assume they can't afford it (ask, don't assume)
- ✗ Get defensive about price (reframe to ROI)
- ✗ Drop price immediately (understand objection first)
- ✗ Accept "no budget" without probing (is it priority or dollars?)

### Red Flags (Low Budget)

**Warning signs**:
- Can't quantify problem cost ("I don't know what it costs us")
- Asks about price in first 5 minutes ("What's your price?")
- Focuses only on cost, not value ("What's your cheapest plan?")
- No budget allocated and no path to secure it ("We have zero budget")
- Compares only on price ("We're going with whoever is cheapest")

**Action if red flags**: Reframe to ROI, but if persistent price focus with no value conversation, score 0.3 or lower

---

## Dimension 4: Urgency (Weight: 0.15)

### Definition

**Is this a priority now?**

Important for sales velocity (15% weight). Low urgency = long sales cycle or no close.

### Key Questions

**Urgency discovery questions**:
1. "When do you need this solved by?" *(timeline)*
2. "What happens if you don't solve this in the next 30/60/90 days?" *(consequence)*
3. "What other priorities are competing for attention?" *(relative urgency)*
4. "What triggered you to look into this now?" *(catalyst event)*
5. "Is there a deadline or event driving this?" *(external pressure)*
6. "Why now vs 6 months ago or 6 months from now?" *(timing)*
7. "What's the cost of waiting?" *(opportunity cost)*
8. "Who's pushing for this to get done?" *(internal pressure)*
9. "If you don't solve this, what's plan B?" *(alternatives)*
10. "On a scale of 1-10, how urgent is this?" *(direct assessment)*

### Scoring Rubric

**1.0 - Urgent, 30-day timeline**:
- Clear deadline (<30 days)
- External pressure (holiday season, compliance, funding, etc.)
- Consequences of inaction are severe
- **Example**: "Peak season starts in 3 weeks. If we don't reduce returns before then, we'll be drowning in CS tickets and losing hundreds of thousands in margins."

**0.7 - Important, 30-60 day timeline**:
- Clear timeline (1-2 months)
- Internal pressure (exec mandate, goal)
- Meaningful consequences of delay
- **Example**: "We want to launch this next quarter. Our CMO made it a priority for Q2, so we need to decide in the next month."

**0.5 - Important but not urgent, 60-90 days**:
- Planning for future (2-3 months)
- No immediate pressure
- Important but flexible timeline
- **Example**: "We're planning this for Q3. It's important but we have time to evaluate properly."

**0.3 - Low urgency, 90+ days**:
- Long-term planning (3+ months)
- No specific deadline
- One of many initiatives
- **Example**: "We're doing annual planning for next year. Just exploring options now."

**0.0 - No urgency, no timeline**:
- No deadline
- Just looking
- Reactive research
- **Example**: "No specific timeline. Just seeing what's out there in case we want to do something in the future."

### Urgency Catalysts

**External catalysts** (create high urgency):
- **Compliance deadline**: "New regulation goes into effect in 60 days"
- **Seasonal pressure**: "Holiday season in 6 weeks, peak returns in January"
- **Funding round**: "Just raised Series A, need to show traction in 90 days"
- **Competitive pressure**: "Competitor just launched feature, we need parity"
- **Customer churn**: "Lost 3 major clients to this problem last month"

**Internal catalysts** (create medium urgency):
- **Executive mandate**: "CEO made this a company priority"
- **Budget cycle**: "Use it or lose it" budget (end of Q, end of year)
- **Goal/OKR**: "It's one of our Q2 OKRs"
- **Team capacity**: "Team is burning out on this problem"

**No catalyst** (low urgency):
- **Research phase**: "Just exploring options"
- **Proactive exploration**: "Seeing what's out there"
- **Long-term planning**: "For next year sometime"

### Red Flags (Low Urgency)

**Warning signs**:
- No specific timeline ("Whenever we get around to it")
- No catalyst ("Just curious")
- Vague consequences ("It would be nice to fix")
- Many competing priorities ("We have 20 other initiatives")
- "Just looking" ("Not buying, just researching")

**Action if red flags**: Score 0.3 or lower, nurture for future (don't spend time on low-urgency prospects)

## Dimension 5: Solution Fit (Weight: 0.15)

### Definition

**Should we sell to them?**

Important for customer success (15% weight). Poor solution fit = churn, bad case study, support burden.

### Key Questions

**Solution fit questions**:
1. "Are you on {required platform}?" *(technical prerequisite)*
2. "Do you have {required capability}?" *(infrastructure requirement)*
3. "What's your {relevant metric}?" *(volume/size fit)*
4. "How technical is your team?" *(implementation complexity)*
5. "What's your ideal solution look like?" *(expectation alignment)*
6. "What features are must-haves vs nice-to-haves?" *(requirements)*
7. "How quickly do you need to go live?" *(implementation timeline)*
8. "What's your experience with tools like this?" *(sophistication)*
9. "What would success look like in 6 months?" *(outcome expectation)*
10. "What would make you churn?" *(deal-breakers)*

### Scoring Rubric

**1.0 - Perfect fit**:
- Meets all ICP criteria
- Problem matches our solution exactly
- No customization needed
- **Example**: "We're on {required platform}, 120 employees, $50M revenue, {X}% {key metric}. We've tried {current approach} and it doesn't work well enough. Looking for {solution type}."

**0.7 - Good fit, minor gaps**:
- Meets most ICP criteria
- Slight deviation acceptable
- Standard implementation
- **Example**: "We're on {acceptable platform} (not {required platform}), but it's a standard setup. 180 employees, just above your typical range. {Key metric} is {X}%."

**0.5 - Can work but requires customization**:
- Some ICP criteria not met
- Would need custom work
- Higher implementation effort
- **Example**: "We're on a custom platform. You'd need to build an integration. We're willing to wait if you can prioritize it."

**0.3 - Poor fit, significant gaps**:
- Multiple ICP criteria not met
- Major customization required
- May not be able to deliver value
- **Example**: "We're on {incompatible platform}, 15 employees, {key metric} is 8%. We want the solution but not sure if we're a good fit."

**0.0 - Not a fit**:
- Wrong ICP entirely
- Different problem
- Can't help effectively
- **Example**: "We're a {different industry} company with no {problem area}. We don't have {key metric}. We were interested in your technology for a different use case."

### Solution Fit Criteria

**Technical fit**:
- Platform/infrastructure requirements
- Integration requirements
- Technical capabilities of their team

**Business fit**:
- Company size (too small = high churn, too large = needs enterprise features)
- Industry (some solutions are industry-specific)
- Geography (support timezone, language, compliance)

**Problem fit**:
- Their problem matches what we solve
- Problem severity matches our solution (not overkill, not insufficient)
- Expectations realistic (we can deliver what they expect)

**Relationship fit**:
- Values alignment (do we want them as a customer?)
- Communication style (will they be a difficult customer?)
- Support needs (are they high-touch or low-touch?)

### Red Flags (Low Solution Fit)

**Warning signs**:
- Outside ICP (too small, too large, wrong geography)
- Wrong platform/tech stack (can't integrate)
- Problem doesn't match our solution (different pain point)
- Unrealistic expectations ("We need this to be 100% perfect")
- Red flag customer behavior (rude, demanding, unreasonable)

**Action if red flags**: Be honest about fit, score 0.5 or lower, may disqualify even if other dimensions strong

## Continuous Qualification Scoring

### Weighted Scoring Formula

```
Total Score = (Problem × 0.3) + (Authority × 0.2) + (Budget × 0.2) + (Urgency × 0.15) + (Solution Fit × 0.15)
```

**Weights rationale**:
- **Problem (30%)**: Most important - no problem, no sale
- **Authority (20%)**: Critical - wrong person, waste time
- **Budget (20%)**: Important - no budget, no close
- **Urgency (15%)**: Important for velocity - low urgency, long cycle
- **Solution Fit (15%)**: Important for retention - poor fit, churn

### Qualification Tiers

**High Qualification (>= 0.8)**:
- **Action**: Schedule demo immediately
- **Expected close rate**: 30-50%
- **Sales cycle**: 30-60 days (fast)
- **Effort**: High priority, drop everything

**Example**:
```
Problem: 0.9 (clear, quantified problem)
Authority: 0.7 (strong influencer, CFO approval needed)
Budget: 0.8 (budget allocated, ROI clear)
Urgency: 0.7 (60-day timeline, important)
Solution Fit: 1.0 (perfect ICP match)

Total: (0.9 × 0.3) + (0.7 × 0.2) + (0.8 × 0.2) + (0.7 × 0.15) + (1.0 × 0.15) = 0.82

→ High qualification: Schedule demo this week
```

**Medium Qualification (0.5 - 0.8)**:
- **Action**: Address gaps, schedule follow-up
- **Expected close rate**: 15-25%
- **Sales cycle**: 60-120 days (medium)
- **Effort**: Worth pursuing, but patient approach

**Example**:
```
Problem: 0.7 (problem exists, not quantified)
Authority: 0.5 (influencer, committee decision)
Budget: 0.5 (unclear, needs business case)
Urgency: 0.5 (90-day timeline, flexible)
Solution Fit: 0.7 (good fit, minor gaps)

Total: (0.7 × 0.3) + (0.5 × 0.2) + (0.5 × 0.2) + (0.5 × 0.15) + (0.7 × 0.15) = 0.61

→ Medium qualification: Address authority gap (get decision-maker on call), send ROI calculator
```

**Low Qualification (< 0.5)**:
- **Action**: Disqualify politely, add to nurture
- **Expected close rate**: <5%
- **Sales cycle**: 120+ days or never
- **Effort**: Don't waste time, move on

**Example**:
```
Problem: 0.3 (vague problem, not prioritized)
Authority: 0.3 (low influence, exploring)
Budget: 0.0 (no budget allocated)
Urgency: 0.3 (no timeline, just looking)
Solution Fit: 0.5 (can work but gaps)

Total: (0.3 × 0.3) + (0.3 × 0.2) + (0.0 × 0.2) + (0.3 × 0.15) + (0.5 × 0.15) = 0.30

→ Low qualification: Disqualify politely, add to 6-month nurture list
```

### Continuous Qualification

**Key principle**: Qualification is continuous, not a one-time gate

**Discovery call**: Initial qualification (0.0-1.0 score)
**Demo call**: Re-qualify (score may change based on new info)
**Proposal stage**: Re-qualify (budget/authority may have shifted)
**Negotiation**: Final qualification (are they really going to sign?)

**Score can go up or down**:
- **Up**: They involve decision-maker (authority +0.3), quantify problem better (problem +0.2)
- **Down**: Budget gets cut (budget -0.3), timeline pushes out (urgency -0.2)

**Action**: Update qualification score after each major touchpoint

---

## Disqualification Criteria

### When to Disqualify

**Disqualify immediately if**:
- **No problem** (Problem score 0.0-0.2): They don't have the problem we solve
- **No authority** (Authority score 0.0-0.2): Can't reach decision-maker, no path forward
- **No budget** (Budget score 0.0-0.2): Can't afford solution, no budget path
- **Poor solution fit** (Solution Fit score 0.0-0.3): Outside ICP, we can't help

**Consider disqualifying if**:
- **Overall score < 0.5**: Multiple dimensions weak, low probability of close
- **Key dimension missing**: E.g., problem strong (0.9) but no authority (0.2) and can't get to decision-maker

### How to Disqualify Professionally

**Script**:
```
"Based on our conversation, I don't think we're the right fit for {Company} right now. [Specific reason: size, budget, problem, etc.] I'd love to stay in touch and check back in {timeline} to see if things have changed. In the meantime, have you looked at {alternative solution}?"
```

**Key elements**:
- Be honest and direct (don't waste their time)
- Provide specific reason (not vague "not a fit")
- Offer to stay in touch (nurture for future)
- Recommend alternative if possible (helpful, builds goodwill)

### Log Disqualification Reasons

**Why log**: Pattern detection (are we targeting wrong companies? Do we need to adjust ICP?)

**What to log**:
- Company name, domain, date
- Disqualification reason (specific dimension + score)
- Overall qualification score
- Re-engagement timeline (if applicable)

**Example log**:
```csv
company,domain,date,reason,problem_score,authority_score,budget_score,urgency_score,fit_score,total_score,re_engage_date
{Customer A},{domain}.com,2024-11-14,"Company size: 15 employees (ICP: 50-200)",0.7,0.5,0.3,0.5,0.3,0.43,2025-05-01
{Customer B},{domain}.com,2024-11-14,"Company size: 5000 employees (ICP: 50-200)",0.8,0.3,0.7,0.5,0.3,0.54,N/A
```

---

## Qualification Best Practices

**Do**:
- ✓ Qualify early and often (don't wait until end of sales process)
- ✓ Be objective (score based on answers, not gut feeling)
- ✓ Ask direct questions (don't dance around budget/authority)
- ✓ Disqualify fast (respect your time and theirs)
- ✓ Document scores (track for learning and pattern detection)

**Don't**:
- ✗ Assume qualification (they reached out ≠ qualified)
- ✗ Skip qualification (eager to demo ≠ good prospect)
- ✗ Sell to unqualified leads (wastes time, hurts metrics)
- ✗ Be afraid to disqualify (it's okay to say no)
- ✗ Use qualification as excuse (if borderline, dig deeper)
