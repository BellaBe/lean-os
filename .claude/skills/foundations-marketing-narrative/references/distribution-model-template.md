# Distribution Model - {Product/Brand}

Generated: {date}
Type: {product | personal-brand}
Framework: Distribution physics (Elena Verna)

## Core Principle

> "Great product is not enough. Distribution wins."

## Distribution Physics (Current Reality)

### What's Dying
| Channel | Status | Evidence |
|---------|--------|----------|
| SEO | Dying | AI answers queries directly |
| Social + links | Clamped | Algorithms punish exits |
| Content calendars | Irrelevant | Attention spans < 1 week |
| Specialist roles | Blurring | Everyone needs multiple hats |

### What's Working
| Channel | Why | Investment |
|---------|-----|------------|
| Product/content loops | Users become distribution | HIGH |
| Founder socials | Personal > corporate | HIGH |
| Ecosystem presence | Stand on others' distribution | HIGH |
| Velocity | Speed as proof of value | HIGH |
| Complexity | Hard to replicate = moat | MEDIUM |

## Loop Design

### Funnel (Old) — Don't Do This
```
Create → Publish → Hope → End
```

### Loop (New) — Do This
```
Create content about solving problem
         ↓
Reader with same problem resonates
         ↓
Engages (comment, DM, share)
         ↓
Tries solution / hires / buys
         ↓
Gets result
         ↓
Shares their result (user-generated)
         ↓
We amplify their story
         ↓
New readers discover...
```

**Every piece of content must answer:** How does this generate the next input?

## Loop Types

| Loop | Input | Action | Output (Reinvested) |
|------|-------|--------|---------------------|
| Content | Post | Reader implements | Shares before/after |
| Product | User | Uses product | Invites others |
| Referral | Happy client | Recommends | New inquiry |
| Expertise | Insight shared | Others cite | Increased authority |

## Growth Model

### For Product
```
Discover → Try → Activate → Convert → Expand → Advocate
```

### For Personal Brand
```
Discover → Consume → Follow → Engage → Hire → Refer
```

| Stage | Loop Trigger |
|-------|--------------|
| Discover | Others sharing your content |
| Consume | Content valuable enough to share |
| Follow | Anticipation of more value |
| Engage | Content that invites response |
| Convert/Hire | Proof you deliver results |
| Advocate/Refer | Their success becomes content |

## Velocity Positioning

> "Velocity of shipping can become your moat."

**Framework:** Before → After with time compression

| Before | After | Multiplier |
|--------|-------|------------|
| {weeks/days} | {minutes/hours} | {Nx} |

**Use in all content.**

## Defensibility

| Factor | Danger Zone | Safe Zone |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Functionality | Simple, single feature | Complex, interconnected |
| Replicability | Can be vibe-coded | Requires methodology |
| Switching cost | Low | Data/memory lock-in |

**Show complexity as proof, not barrier.**

## Channel Strategy

| Channel | Investment | Purpose | Loop Mechanic |
|---------|------------|---------|---------------|
| Founder LinkedIn | HIGH | Primary distribution | Post → Engage → DM → Hire → Case study |
| Ecosystem presence | HIGH | Stand on others' reach | Visibility → Discovery → Follow |
| Product/content | HIGH | Users as distribution | Use → Share output → New users |
| Blog/SEO | LOW | Long-tail only | Don't depend on it |
| Email | MEDIUM | Nurture existing | Loop trigger in every email |

## Content Triggers

**Publish when:**
- User success story available (loop fuel)
- Genuine learning occurred
- Velocity story to tell
- Community question with loop potential

**Don't publish:**
- Calendar says so
- Engagement bait
- No loop potential
- Regurgitated advice

## Metrics That Matter

| Ignore | Track |
|--------|-------|
| Impressions | Loop activations |
| Followers | Inbound conversations |
| Likes | Implementations |
| Traffic | User-generated content |
| Volume | Content that generated content |
