# Loop Content Pattern

**Purpose:** Content designed to generate its own next input
**Required for:** All content types

## Structure

| Section | Purpose | Required |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Hook | Problem/insight that resonates | Yes |
| Velocity proof | Before → After with time | Yes |
| Method/insight | What you did (teachable) | Yes |
| Result | Specific outcome | Yes |
| Loop trigger | Invitation to respond/implement | Yes |

## Loop Trigger Types

| Type | Best For | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| Implementation | Tutorials, frameworks | "Try this and share your result" |
| Question | Insights, observations | "What's your version of this?" |
| Challenge | Methods, templates | "Rewrite yours. Tag me." |
| Offer | Problem posts | "Facing this? DM me" |

## Velocity Framing

Required in every piece:
```
{Time period} to {old way}.
{Shorter time} to {new way}.
```

Examples:
- "Three weeks to build. Twenty minutes to realize it was wrong."
- "Days of writing. Minutes of review."
- "Weeks to create the problem. Minutes to fix it."

## Voice Adaptations

- Direct, actionable (not theoretical)
- Specific numbers (velocity proof)
- Honest about limitations
- Invites participation (not broadcast)

## Anti-patterns

| Don't | Why |
|-------|-----|
| End without loop trigger | No next input generated |
| Broadcast without engagement hook | Funnel, not loop |
| "Let me know what you think" | Vague, low activation |
| Engagement bait without substance | Violates brand voice |
| Links in LinkedIn posts | Algorithm punishes |

## Example
```markdown
Three weeks to build a pitch deck.

Twenty minutes to realize the positioning was wrong.

We spent three weeks on slides. Animations. Graphics.
Then a founder friend said: "I don't get what you do."

That's when we rebuilt the story in 20 minutes with ABT:
- AND: We help merchants do X
- BUT: They struggle with Y  
- THEREFORE: We built Z

Everything clicked. Same product. Different story.

Weeks to create the problem. Minutes to fix it.

What story are you overcomplicating?
Rewrite it as AND/BUT/THEREFORE.

**Loop mechanics:**
- Velocity proof: weeks → minutes
- Teachable method: ABT framework
- Loop trigger: Challenge type ("Rewrite and share")
- Expected output: User attempts → engagement → visibility → more attempts
