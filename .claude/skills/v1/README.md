# V1 Engineering Skills (Legacy)

**Status:** Deprecated - Archived December 2025
**Use Instead:** V2 engineering skills

## What This Contains

V1 engineering skills used a phase-based "Prover" pattern:

- `engineering-backend-prover` - Backend code generation
- `engineering-frontend-prover` - Frontend TypeScript generation
- `engineering-infrastructure-prover` - Infrastructure deployment configs
- `engineering-proof-composer` - Proof chain validation
- `engineering-system-architecture` - Requirements to specifications
- `engineering-standardization-applier` - Apply standards
- `engineering-standardization-definer` - Define standards

## Why Deprecated

V2 introduces a 12-level categorical architecture that provides:

- **Completeness** - Manifest-driven validation
- **Traceability** - Full lineage from L0-L11
- **Universality** - Domain-agnostic patterns
- **Modularity** - Smaller, composable skills

## Migration Path

| V1 Skill | V2 Equivalent |
|----------|---------------|
| engineering-backend-prover | v2/engineering-code-architect |
| engineering-frontend-prover | v2/engineering-code-architect |
| engineering-infrastructure-prover | v2/engineering/ (L11) |
| engineering-proof-composer | v2/engineering-proofs-architect |
| engineering-system-architecture | v2/engineering/ (L0-L8) |

## Do Not Use

These skills are preserved for reference only. All new engineering work should use V2.
